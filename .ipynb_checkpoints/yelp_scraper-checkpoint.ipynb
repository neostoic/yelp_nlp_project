      "Need I even write a review?  Took my love here for his birthday.  Each had a different tasting menu with wine pairing.  First time I've ever spent 4 figures on dinner for two and I would do it again in a heartbeat!  From the moment we walked in we were taken on a beautiful journey and treated like royalty.  The service was flawless, the courses outstanding, the attention to detail-- impeccable.  I'm still dreaming about my oeufs au caviar.  Legendary and 3 Michelin stars with reason! I had high expectations of Jean-Georges. I feel the takeaway did not quite meet the expectations that I had going into the restaurant.  The service was absolutely spotless. The bathrooms... not so much... the bathroom was very small and felt very cramped... something I would not have expected from a 3 star. The food, although good, was not as fulfilling as I hoped it would be. Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent and worth every penny. I just felt that the cuisine I ate did not match me. To the general consumer, I can see that this place might be out of their league with all the intricacies. Which is why this is a 3 star. It is NOT for the general consumer and instead, for someone that appreciates the technique and research that is put into each dish.  I felt that if I had a finer palate I would have enjoyed myself more... maybe? Went to JG with my mom on her first visit in NYC. Tried the dinner chef signature. The tasting overall is a very beautiful experience and the highlights are definitely the the turbot with chateaux chalon sauce, the foie gras pancake, as well as the frog legs. The flavor of the white wine sauce is out of this world!  The dessert however wasn't as stunning. The classic JG duo was very nice. But my favorites the gold foil chestnut wafer. The service was exceptional and the decor is very elegant! A revisit to JG after seven months and this time I decided to try the tasting menu. Two versions of tasting menu were provided, seasonal tasting and JG tasting, both were delicious. This was probably the fastest dinner I have had, well within two hours to finish up every course. Among the dishes, I enjoyed the egg caviar, lobster, as well as the strawberry tasting. Till the end of the meal, they brought the fruit sorbet, which was freezingly good. I would recommend the tasting menu, however a la carte, which was what I have ordered last time, might not be a good try. I've been to Jean George a few times and everytime service was great. The views from the dining room are amazing. The windows are almost from ceiling to floor.  It is a course menu and everything I tried was delicious. I docked it 1 star because the last time I went, I found d a hair in my bread!! Eekkkk!! I notified our waiter and they quickly apologized and replaced my bread. They also gave everyone at the table a complimentary dessert tasting plate, which was a very nice gesture.  Regardless of the hair incident, I will probably go back. The food didn't deliver in the way I'd hoped. Although much of it was good, nothing was especially memorable. Of course, it is much better than almost every other restaurant but there are most definitely better tasting options in the city at a fraction of the cost.  The service was good, but a bit overbearing and self important. It felt like I was watching a movie that I didn't like that much and the usher kept telling me how amazing the next scene was going to be. Yet despite the waiter's best effort, I continued to be sort of dissatisfied.  That said the dining room and the view were unbelievable. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. Definitely worth every penny every time I've been here.  The staff is exceptional, always welcoming, over the years I have not had anything that's not good on the menu. My personal favorites are the Sea Trout and Oyster Tartare, the Slowly Cooked Hake and of course the Warm Chocolate Cake What else can I say that other yelpers before me hasn't said yet? Jean Georges totally deserves that elusive three Michelin stars. Those Michelin people might want to add another star tho cause it was that good for me.  Took the boyfriend to Jean Georges for his birthday late last year. We both felt like it was our birthday tho lol.  We decided on the three course meal with a 4th course. I was skeptical on how much food we're getting with a 3 course and I was already thinking about where to get pizza after it since for sure we will still be hungry. But no. Their three course meal was a real meal that can definitely be enough.  The amuse bouche, petit fours, dessert and even the palate cleansers that came on top of the 3 courses was lovely. I cannot pick a favorite since I loved everything I got. Service was on point as it should be but does not feel pretentious. We had a laugh or two with our server and we felt very comfortable in the space.  Those Michelin people really do know what they're doing lol. After having the most perfect meal in my existence on this earth at Le Bernardin the night before which was also a Michelin 3 star restaurant I was shocked to find this place was worse than a restaurant chain and was over $500 bucks for 2 people. We ordered the Chef Vongerichten's assortment of signature dishes as it looked like it would be a great choice. Where do I start? Being sat down right in front of 2 tables staring directly at us the whole time? Or the fact they brought out items that weren't complete? Or the lady serving the bread plate snapped at me when I said I wanted to try each of the 5 breads? I asked about one item as I was tasting some cayenne pepper, and the server said no there was no cayenne pepper in it. She came back later and didn't apologize and said \"by the way there was cayenne pepper in the lemongrass soup\". I am okay with that, but not a Michelin 3 star restaurant. This place was next to a joke as only one course was delicious (pigeon and foie gras) the rest not worth even trying for free. I guess the bar was set too high from Le Bernadin, or Gary Danko 1 Michelin star in San Fran. Will never come back, will never recommend this place, and still sad I paid so much money for subpar food. Death by foie gras! What a way to go! An amazing experience. We will definitely be back. Hope I can find room for dessert:). When visiting New York, we made reservations for Jean-Georges, with relatively high expectations since it's a 3 Michelin Star restaurant. Food: 3.5/5 The food in general was mediocre. The chef integrated a lot of floral, herbal stuff in the food since it was spring/summer, but a lot of the sauce they used was overpowering and covered the actual taste of the main ingredient. The caviar creations though, were definitely worth trying and probably one of the best main dishes that they have. The egg caviar and the potato bubble caviars were both amazing. Our main courses however, were disappointing, and they overcooked my duck, making it super dry and tough. The waiters compensated for their mistake by serving us every single dessert they had on the menu to make up for the disappointing main course that I had.  Service: 5/5 The service was absolutely amazing. To compensate for my poorly made, overcooked main course, the waiter, instead of letting us have a disappointing end to the dinner, served us every single dish on the dessert menu, and that definitely put us all in a very good mood at the end of dinner, despite the disappointing quality of the food. Jean Georges. 3 Michelin Stars in 2015. 10 years in a row. #98 on The San Pellegrino's 2014 World's 50 Best Restaurants. #19 in 2009. #17 in 2008. #18 in 2007. #16 in 2006. #9 in 2005. #18 in 2004. JG is no amatuer when it comes to fine dining like I'm no amatuer when it comes to eating or being a complete a-hole.  The restaurant is located in the Trump hotel and right across from Central Park. They seated us next to the window and I had the sun shining on me, but it wasn't uncomfortable like watching your married friends argue in public. It's a really pretty, bright, and vibrant restaurant on Saturday, April 4, 2015.  Sorry got the club going up on a Tuesday. The service was superb and the wait staff was amazing. Alissa and Caroline made our dining experience exceptional. They always came by to check up on us and always had a Colgate smile on their faces. In addition, they did a fantastic job of explaining the prep and ingredients of the dish. Our water and drinks were never empty. They both deserve a raise and a promotion.  Now, the tasting menu. Jean Georges had a prix fix menu with two courses and a tasting menu with 5-6 courses. We decided to go with the tasting menu because we're fat.  1) Caviar - Caviar on top of Parisienne Potatoes. Who would have thought to combine those two items? The caviar was amazing and wasn't overwhelmingly salty. The texture of potatoes was soft and firm at the same time. It looked like a dessert when it was served in a champagne glass. I would have preferred it in a red cup like the ones people use for beer pong. Classy. 2) Suckling Pig - The pig was served with beets and it had more color than the rainbow while you were on shrooms. The Suckling Pig had a crispy outer shell and tender inside like me. It was lightly seasoned with sea salt and every bite was a delight. The only issue was the presentation. I'm color blind so I didn't get to see all the colors on the plate. There was red, purple, and yellow. I think. I wished they would have served this in a black chalkboard, so I could distinguish the colors. Classy. 3) Cod - The cod was slow cooked and served with a Spring Lettuce Puree and Herbal-Lime Vinaigrette.  It was topped with a cracker that resembled a Vietnamese Sesame Baked Rice Cracker. The lean cod had a mild taste and very delicate in texture. It broke apart into large flakes as you ate it.  It was definitely an enjoyable dish. I thought the presentation could have been better and it should have been served in a paper plate. Classy.  Overall, Jean Georges was awesome experience. The service, food and ambiance was great. I definitely recommend Jean Georges for those who are more price conscious with it comes to tasting menus. If you don't want the tasting menu, there's a two course prix fix menu. However, I don't recommend the two course cause you will be wasting your time and experience. 7 down. 5 more. We tried the summer tasting menu and wine pairing on a Sunday evening. As per all 3 Star Michelin places, the service, wine pairings, ambiance etc were amazing. My only complaint would be that if you go in the evenings (we went at 915pm) it is very dimly lit (ie can't Instagram the food well).  Surprisingly this restaurant is great for groups. The round tables have intimate 2-seat couches which are paired with single chairs. Despite being very open, you still feel like yours is the only table in the room which matters.  The summer tasting menu is as light as one would expect for French food but lots of fruit and Asian influences are incorporated into the dishes. But none of them are particularly spicy, for those with a low spice tolerance.  Each Michelin starred spot is kind of it's own entity, so it's hard to benchmark against others. But in comparison to Alinea in Chicago, I'd say there is less fanfare in the presentation but a high degree of refinement.  I can't wait to go back to try next season's menu! OMG!!! I love this place! We were here for a lunch date because it is very decent pricing for a Michelin restaurant. About $50/person for the lunch menu. You get to pick an appetizer and an entre. Adding dessert $12 (we shared that because we were so full). We originally thought we would not get full and have small servings. Not at all! We left there fully stuffed and satisfied! They give you some chef's compliments to try. Coconut smoothie: not sweet, very thick and creamy. tasted like pure coconut meat puree. very fresh.  Passion fruit lime soda: not sweet, a bit too acidic for my taste. still fresh tasting.  Sea urchin app: first sea urchin experience and I am in love. I don't know if I will like another sea urchin dish like this. the flavor/sauce they had on it was very delicious and complimented the dish very well. I wish I had more though! They were 3 small pieces of bread topped with urchin. The urchin was melt on your tongue delicious!  Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons: my husband's dish that I also love too! I am in a dilemma! If I come here again, I don't know how I will be able to choose between the two appetizers. The tuna was plentiful and the sauce was perfect for it. My husband enjoyed it but knew how much I love tuna, gave me half of it! :D  Black Sea Bass Crusted with Nuts and Seeds, Sweet and Sour Jus: loved my entre dish. not as much as I loved the sea urchin, but I was definitely satisfied with my choice. The sauce once again makes this dish.  Which is strange, at Le Bernardin, I got the black bass with truffle hot and sour sauce and that was probably the worst dish I've experienced.  My husband's Veal Scallopine: it was okay for me, but my hubby enjoyed it a lot.  Caramel dessert: delicious!! I loved everything on it! Especially the white meringue thing that I think was the \"floating island\"  Dcor: beautiful, bright and elegant. Natural light from all the windows. Not too modern.  This is definitely top 5 restaurant experiences we've had. If ever I come back to New York, we are going to have dinner here and try their more extensive menu. Whenever I think back to my meal at Jean-Georges in April, I'm reminded of a scene from Disney's Ratatouille: Remy eating a strawberry and a nugget of cheese, eyes closed to savor every bite, tasting the layers of flavors as they unfold one by one, progressing like an inspiring symphony.  We were visiting Boston for the marathon but decided to stop by NYC for a couple of days. I try to go to a Michelin-rated restaurant whenever possible while traveling, and since Craig P. and I were also celebrating an early anniversary, I narrowed my selection down to Le Bernardin, Jean-Georges, and Per Se. Not many fine dining places offer weekend lunch menus, so JG it was! Reservations for 1:45 PM were easily made via OpenTable. We underestimated the time it'd take to get to the Trump Hotel and were about 20-minutes late. I called ahead to let them know and there were very understanding. The restaurant is tastefully decorated with fresh flowers at every table and floor-to-ceiling windows that bring in a ton of natural light. We checked-in our bags and coats with the hostess and were immediately seated in a private booth, facing the dining room. Libations I had a server-recommended Strawberry Champagne cocktail that was delightful and exactly what I was looking for. Craig had some sort of fruity whiskey smash, which he very much enjoyed. It was a bit too strong for him considering it was daytime, so our server brought additional fruit syrup/puree for Craig to mix in to his liking. Amuse-Bouches Radish Over Ricotta Cheese & Black Olive Oil Tasmanian Trout Over Spicy Mayonnaise & Crispy Rice Spring Herb Soup Bread Service Three different selections of bread to choose from, served alongside some of the best butter I've ever had the pleasure of consuming. 2-course Tastes of Spring Lunch Menu ($48 pp) Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons Sauteed Gulf Shrimp & Smoked Bacon Parmesan Crusted Organic Chicken Seared Beef Tenderloin ($20 suppl.) Dessert Caramel ($12) Anniversary Chocolate Cake Mignardises Hibiscus Chocolate Banana Caramel Chocolate Coconut Chocolate Macaron Mandarin Orange Jelly Madagascar Vanilla Marshmallow Everything was so simple, flavorful, and delicious. We loved everything, which is rare for us. All four savory dishes were so tasty, that I don't know how to pick a favorite; they were all equally wonderful and unique in their own way. Jean-Georges excels at combining the simplest ingredients to achieve innovative, robust plates that have a multitude of flavors, without being too heavy. There was also a hint of Asian influence, which I'm normally not a fan of, but it worked. Dessert was a tad underwhelming, but still very solid and satisfied my sweet tooth. The most memorable was probably the marshmallows; those were fantastic! Service was good. Craig did manage to get them to break \"character\" -- not that the staff was stuffy, but they were all very professional, cordial, and in sync with another. We attempted a few jokes to no avail and finally did it when they brought out a complimentary anniversary cake and Craig exclaimed, \"Yup, two weeks in!\" We had a lot of fun and I'm grateful they were good sports. We were also checked on consistently without it being intrusive, which was greatly appreciated. Michelin: 3 stars (2015)  World's 50 Best: no. 98 (2014) Absolutely fantastic! Almost $400 for 2 people but I guess it's worth it! Our server was very helpful and friendly. She is great at recommending the menu items. There are pre-fix (four course including dessert) or chef tasting menu ( 7 course I believe which takes longer). They also offer small tasting (appetizer and dessert in between our meals) which was great! Make sure you don't hv theater plans (cuz I feel like I should've arrange more time to enjoy this meal-- I only had about 2 hours). Lunch Pricing: $48 for 2 course prix fixe Foie gras brulee had an additional $8 charge Suckling pig had an additional $10 charge Dessert tasting menu $12 The cheapest 3 star Michelin near me is Benu (in San Francisco), and a meal there starts at $228 per person. When I stumbled across Jean Georges' $48 two course prix fixe lunch while checking out New York restaurants, I had my credit card out and a reservation made in minutes.  The service is impeccable, but I think that's to be expected of any Michelin restaurant. The staff to customer ratio is probably the highest I've experienced at a restaurant so far. They also offered an amuse bouche at beginning of the meal and mignardises at the end. The lunch crowd also made for some interesting people watching. There was a mix of business people, people celebrating special occasions, and some old money rich people who ate their expensive lunch as casually as if they had lunch there everyday (which I wouldn't be surprised by).  I usually find Michelin star restaurants to be a bit of a disappointment, and sadly Jean Georges proved to be another one for me. I think I always go into them with too many expectations. Between the high prices and the prestigious award, I always walk into them with the hope that I'm going to blown away by every course, and maybe that's too much to ask for. I had the foie gras brulee as my first course and the crispy confit of suckling pig as my second. Both came with additional charges. Both were gorgeously plated. The plating here is some of the best I've seen, but neither one really hit the spot for me in terms of flavor. They were good, but not the mind blowingly delicious dishes I was hoping to get out of a 3 star restaurant. My friends, who aren't normally into expensive dining and weren't quite sure what to expect, got the goat cheese gnocchi and the sweet and spicy glazed sweet breads. They also agreed their meals were good, but nothing amazing. In all honesty, I've had better food at lower prices.  Where Jean Georges completely knocked it out of the park though was on the desserts. I was resigning myself to the idea that 3 stars don't mean very much, when I decided to give the desserts a try. Desserts are offered as a tasting menu. They give you a list of four flavors to choose from, and will then present you with a plate carrying a few desserts that fit that flavor theme. I opted for caramel, and received one of the best desserts I have ever had. There was a scoop of salted caramel ice cream, a floating island, and caramel puff pastry. I could've licked the plate because it was so delicious. If I ever come back here, I would completely skip entrees and order myself 3 desserts because it was foodgasmic. That dessert was everything I was hoping Jean Georges would be. As an added bonus, we got a chocolate tasting menu to share for the table as well because one of the entrees had been too spicy for one of my friends.  In summary, service was great, entrees were ok, and dessert was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. This review is for lunch in the Jean-Georges dining room only. We enjoy Jean-Georges so much as to have visited it consistently 3 years in a row for our anniversary. For our first anniversary, we were only able to snag a lunch reservation, so it's been kind of a tradition for the last couple years to do lunch instead of dinner here. Not to mention, it's a fantastic deal. You can choose two plates for $48, with each additional plate running $24. I'd argue that this is one of, if not the, best value for lunch in Manhattan. Consider that Jean-Georges retains a consistent 3-star Michelin rating, and has also been featured in the list of the World's 50 Best Restaurants for many years in a row. Now tell me that a ~$50 lunch here isn't a steal! There's an option to do a $158 tasting menu here for lunch, but I've found that I actually prefer to order off the  la carte menu. The tasting menu usually just seems like too much food for me (especially at lunch time), but YMMV. When we visited here last (June 2015), the summer menu offered a $40 caviar supplement. I opted for the warm glazed potato dish, and it was excellent. For my main dish, I had the slowly cooked hake. Everything was cooked to perfection, with subtle flavoring.  The best thing about JG really, is that it's not overly pretentious and doesn't cater to the latest trends. The food is innovative, without flaunting odd foam/molecular gastronomy creations. Here you will find delicious, expertly crafted, and recognizable food.  JG also offers a couple extras that really make the lunch service exemplary. The amuse-bouche is always fantastic. And for dessert, house-made marshmallow and extra desserts are brought to the table. We've also been given an extra chocolate mousse cake each year decorated for our anniversary. We'll continue this tradition as long as we can, and I can't wait to try the dinner service as well. J ust... so starstruck... my first Michelin experience! E verything about this place screams PERFECTION A nd I couldn't have asked for a better bday dinner N o, \"Over $61\" is not at all an accurate Price Range :P G et errything. Eat all the things. ALL OF THEMS. E very choice on the menu is ridiculously superb O rdered the Spring Menu = 7 courses + 2 mini R eally loved 110% of it... presentation, taste, service G awd it was embarrassing that I couldn't finish it all E ven got a free fancy cake and EXTRA DESSERTS S o had quite the bag of leftovers to take home / end normal review Breaking all my rules now and writing in paragraphs, because I am bubbling over with more to say about this place... and there just aren't enough letters in 'Jean Georges' -_-;; Our servers were amazing. It was like choreographed dance numbers, so graceful and composed and synchronized when they removed our dirty wares, presented new dishes, refilled our waters... everything to the last detail. And there must be hidden audio surveillance in the seats or something, because it seemed they always knew immediately if I needed anything at all. I really enjoyed my first cocktail, but I mentioned under my breath that it was a little too spicy for me, and the server swooped in and recommended something new and delicious and perfect and totally replaced it and didn't charge me for the first one. AMAZINGS. And what's more? We'd both ordered the same Spring Menu, which came with the decadent Rhubarb Dessert Tasting, and I was feeling a lil birthday-spoiled and whiny and whispered it would've been better if we got to try two different tastings... so at the end of our courses, they brought one Rhubarb and one Chocolate Dessert Tasting too. HOW DO THEY DO IT. My birthday dinner ended up over $300 per person. So if you are not MADE OF MONEHS then don't make this your weekly date night spot. Definitely save it for special occasions. Plan to make your reservations well in advance if you want a typical, normal eating hour... but if you are like us and don't mind 10:30pm dinner, then by all means, last minute planning might work out alright. And I think our free extra desserts [seemingly random assortment of caramel-y beautiful yumminess] at the end were thanks to the fact that we were the last ones there as they were closing for the night :P I am in love with this place. I only want to eat here for the rest of my life. Incroyable! Three Michelin stars that were well deserved. Get yourself to Jean-Georges, pronto! I had the most loveliest lunch here at Jean-Georges. (One of my top bookmarks that needed to be crossed off as soon as possible!) The restaurant is located inside the Trump International Hotel & Tower (overlooking Central Park) so if you are facing the building, enter through the doors on your left. The right side will lead you inside the hotel lobby. Once inside, check in with the hosts (they have several) and give them your coat if you've brought one. They don't like people putting their heavy coats or jackets on the back of the chairs, so utilize their coat room.   Once seated, I was greeted by one of the friendly waitstaff that brought over a variety of different breads. I love that! It reminded me of Wolfgang Puck's Spago and CUT, two of my favorite restaurants in L.A. (I love to eat bread so having more than one option always makes me happy.) After perusing through the menu, I opted to go with the \"Tastes of Autumn\". This includes two courses for $48 and each additional plate for $24. (Some of the items listed have an extra supplement charge as well.) The wine list was nice but since it was a bit too early for alcohol (at least for me), I went with one of their homemade fruit and herbal sodas. The cherry-yuzu soda was delightful and refreshing! A nice balance between the two fruits and the soda water.  Before the main dishes arrived, my palate was entertained with a trio of amuse-bouche. Tuna tartare w/ avocado on top of a crispy tapioca cracker, a single Kumamoto oyster in a cloud of red wine vinegar and roasted chestnut broth with wild mushroom ravioli. All three were delicious and made my taste buds dance with joy! :) The savory dishes that I ordered: Diver Scallops, Caramelized Cauliflower, Caper-Raisin Emulsion ($8 Supplement) - Delicious. The scallops were cooked to perfection, oh my! Very pleasing in taste along with the caramelized cauliflower, which had a slight char on the florets. The caper-raisin emulsion was slightly sweet (with a hint of nutmeg) and tangy, mmm! I believe this is one of Jean-Georges's signature dishes so it's a must. Butternut Squash Soup with Black Trumpet Mushrooms - So good! They brought out the mushrooms and then poured the soup in while I waited. The soup was creamy and rich in flavor. One of the best butternut squash soups I've ever tasted! The mushrooms were very flavorful too. I wanted the bowl to magically refill itself, lol!  Crispy Confit of Suckling Pig, Rutabaga \"Pudding\" and Smoked Bacon Marmalade ($10 Supplement) - Amazing! A heavy dish even though it is presented to look quite simple. Pulled pork that was moist, with the top, fatty layer of skin left crispy, sprinkled with a bit of sea salt. So many flavors! The marmalade and the rutabaga pudding complimented this dish so well. I thoroughly enjoyed the pudding with every bite of the pork. Yummy! For the dessert tasting, there were four to choose from: Chocolate, Caramel, Citrus and December. I went with the Caramel ($12) -   - Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Caramelized Banana - Floating Island, Vanilla Anglaise, Spun Sugar - Crisp Puff Pastry, Warm Caramel Pastry Cream  So delectable and the presentation was so pretty! My favorite was the floating island with the marshmallow. (Oh, how I love crme anglaise!) The perfect ending to a perfect meal...or so I thought! A complimentary plate of petits fours and homemade vanilla marshmallows were brought to the table afterwards. They bring out a little cart with the marshmallows and cut them for you. Pretty sweet huh? (Yes, pun intended.) Service was impeccable from start to finish so you will be treated very well. Just don't come dressed like a bum! Keep it classy folks. When you make your reservation, asked to be seated in the main dining room. It is so chic! The daylight pouring in from outside, combined with the view by the windows, is so lovely. Egg Caviar.  Those two words are enough to make me throw on a cocktail dress and run out the door. People expect a lot from Jean-Georges signature restaurant, and he delivers.  The atmosphere manages to be both warm yet slightly modern. I have snagged a corner the three times I've been here so that we both get to sit on the comfy banquette (a simple request on OpenTable always seals the deal). The seasonal tasting menus are always orgasmic, and I find the wine pairings to be among the best I've ever enjoyed. I should also note that their by the glass wine list is impressive, should you choose not to pair (BIG MISTAKE)! Great for that aperitif, though. I was pleasant surprised to see Gatinois offered by the glass, which contributed to the perfect champagne cocktail- my go-to cocktail before a dinner like this.  Now back to the egg caviar. I could eat this first course every day for the rest of my life and die a happy woman. The light texture of the eggs served in an eggshell topped with caviar is one of the best things of ever put in my mouth (insert sexual joke here). Every course is a hit. From the fish to the meat, every dish is exquisite, both in flavor and plating. I can truly say that I've yet to have a course I didn't enjoy here. I don't particularly love raisins, but in an emulsion with capers and cauliflower atop diver scallops, they're the best damn raisins ever.  Service is spot-on but not intrusive. Don't even get me started on the bread. It's like the guy knows when I'm thinking about one of the mouth-watering options and magically appears. Dishes are served seamlessly, with descriptions that glide off the tip of the server's tongue with ease. Love that. Since the tasting menu experience lasts a good 3-4 hours, there is never a rush to get diners out. By the fifth course, I'm knee-deep in the sauce and I don't get the stink-eye from any of the staff, which is a plus. The dessert courses are in a league of their own. See photos, because I'll pass out if I keep describing these things whilst eating an apple and drinking a Diet Coke. Le sigh.  Special occasion or not, Jean-Georges is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Highly, highly recommended.  NB: I've only enjoyed dinner here, so my review reflects the seasonal dinner tasting menus. Wow, the service and food is truly impeccable. The tiniest detail to the flavors is truly a once in a lifetime experience! So happy and grateful that we were able to try the menu! Every dish was perfect from the beginning to the end. My favorite dish was the tuna ribbon. The sea bass was also unique in flavor, the broth was rich and earthy.  Made my husbands birthday celebration perfect! Thank you for the quality service!! This swanky restaurant is located in the Donald Trump hotel. They have an upscale seating area that requires guest to wear formal gear. Therefore you will have to leave your jeans and T-shirts at home. You gotta dress the part for this meal for sure...Since we did not dress up the part for the night we were still able to enjoy a nice dinner at their secondary dining room which is called Nougatine at Jean Georges. Which has a very nice romantic/cool ambiance, pretty classy I must say, but any who lets talk about the food now. The tasting menu $98 which included Tuna Tartare with avocado, spicy radish, and ginger marinade (They serve seasonal, more casual dinners here by the way.) which was very fresh and mouth watering. One of the best I have ever had. The sauce its what made it mouth watering. I thought it was better then Michael Mina's tuna tartare..ekk. Then we had Foie Gras Brule (duck liver!!) with strawberry syrup and aged balsamic. Never thought I would like it so much! Soo delicious by the way! The Poppy Seed Crusted Salmon was very fresh too. It was very soft and moist with lots of flavor maybe it was the poppy seeds and summer squash with nasturtium vinaigrette that made it extra tasty, it almost dissolved in your mouth. We also had a very savory Grilled Beef Tenderloin cooked to perfection here (medium rare, chefs recommendation) that included three sauces. One was a red chilli spicy sauce, the other one was a white garlicky sauce and the third one was parsley. All of them were very very good! I would love to come here again! Soon I hope! I recommend this restaurant if you're in the mood to explore something a little more upscale with freshness and high quality ingredients. Jean-Georges is absolutely brilliant. All of their food was well-balanced, beautifully simple, and just about as close to perfect as you could imagine. Sure, it's certainly expensive, however, you're truly paying for an amazing experience. Our server was excellent, and the bartenders were more than happy to mix our table unique cocktails. There is a reason this is one of the highest rated restaurants in Manhattan. Superb. Kinda eerily spookily perfect.   Which you expect coming in.  And are not disappointed with going out.    Lunch here will spoil your dinner. But it very well might be the best lunch deal on the planet.  Portions are large enough that you don't need the additional course when offered.  Wine list is surprisingly approachable while remaining expertly curated.   Can't miss. An amazing experience overall and service was particularly excellent.  The decor is chic, calm, and simple. There is nothing to add, nothing to remove. It is just the right equilibrium. The food is at the image of the place. One word- BLISS.  From the moment you enter the establishment, you are treated with nothing but pure class. My fianc and I dined for lunch and indulged in the prix fix option. Each course was so thoughtfully designed and most importantly, each course tasted beyond spectacular.. Highly recommend the prix fix option! Each dish was crafted with the freshest of ingredients- from the fish to the lamb to the house made macaroons. The service, Caroline, specifically, took the greatest care of us from making sure each of our courses was then appropriately crafted and water and wine were topped off and appropriately placed on the table.  Jean Georges is absolutely a stand out establishment and deserves each Michelin star awarded to them. Highly, highly recommend! Food: 5 Stars Service: 5+ Stars I came here for lunch with my girlfriend over the summer and it was and still is the best meal of my life. I don't know what exactly, but every element of the dining experience was so perfect. First, to start, the service from the moment we walked into the door was absolutely impeccable. They pulled out our table when we were being seated, and might I saw we had a magnificent table that overlooked the entire restaurant. Haha, it almost made us feel like Kings and Queens. Every time the servers brought over a course, everything was synchronized and they always had at least 2 servers. Explanations were clear and detailed, and they easily answered any questions we had. Another quick note, my girlfriend is vegetarian and since the lunch menu didn't have too many choices for a main course, the waiter said that he could easily make a custom dish after consulting with the chef.  We opted for the Tastes of Spring choice that they had during lunch: 1. Starting with the bread, they had about 4 kinds that you could choose from. We opted for the sourdough, dark grains, and a sesame bread. My girlfriend loved the dark grains one and one of our servers picked up on this on his own after coming a couple of times with the bread plate selection. At a certain point, he would actually automatically present the type she liked when we were interested in more bread. The intuition and observation was why I thought service here was absolutely the best I've ever encountered. I will say it is a little bit on the stuffier and more professional side, but I truly enjoy it. Additionally, while some fine dining restaurants have often treated me and my girlfriend differently because we appear to be younger, we honestly felt that at Jean-Georges, we had the same level of service with other groups or older couples beside us.  2. Amuse Bouche - This was quite unique. I don't remember exactly what each of them were, but there was a type of green yogurt drink that tasted very much like cheese. Pickled cucumbers. Finally a smoked filet of salmon on top of sunflower seeds and yogurt. Presentation was truly innovative and eye-opening for all of these. I was super impressed right off the bat. And of course, since they knew that my girlfriend was vegetarian after we had ordered, they had replaced the salmon on the Amuse Bouche with a nice dark beet which was also delicious. 3. Foie Gras (Dried Sour Cherries, Candied Pistachios and White Port Gelee): Although it did include a supplement charge, this was truly decadent. By far, my favorite course of the meal. The foie gras was so smooth and had a great balance with the sweet elements on the plate including the cherries, and pistachios as well as oat flakes (?). I never knew that you could create such a wonderful blend of flavors between the savory nature of foie gras and the sweet, tart flavors of fruits.  4. Goat Cheese Royale (Roasted Beet Marmalade and Toasted Crushed Pistachios): For the first course, my girlfriend ordered the Goat Cheese Royale which resembled a type of yogurt that came with pistachios and beets. It looked beautiful and she said it tasted really amazing as well.  5. Suckling Roast Pig: With a very crisp upper layer and different kinds of sauces mixed into the plate with flavor ranging from oils and vinegars, I thought this dish was very unique as well. I actually enjoyed and savored the top layer of the suckling as it had a crisp texture as well as being very flavorful. I thought the presentation was very unique as well with the color of the beets that came on the dish mixing with the sauces on the plate.  6. Vegetable Pasta: The custom dish that they created for my girlfriend was a type of pasta that came with green peas, asparagus, grated cheese on top and other kinds of vegetables I don't remember anymore. She said that it was amazing and we could tell that the pasta noodles were definitely freshly made with beautiful texture. 7. For dessert, I believe we ordered \"Summer\" which came with on the left, a type of jelly with peaches inside, ice cream and also mini bread pudding croutons sprinkled on top. The right side came with blueberries surrounding a pastry with powdered sugar and more peaches. I wasn't the most impressed with the dessert as it came out a little too sour on the left and more of a sweet taste on the right, didn't mix well.  8. But fear not! We got a celebratory chocolate cake that actually had gold leaf on top and a Happy Anniversary signage to the sign with lighted candles as well. This was truly decadent and beautifully presented. Super impressed with the restaurants hospitality. In addition, there were more dessert tastings including a chocolate plate, marshmallow pieces, and pink macaroons. Gosh we love dessert :) At a very reasonable price for lunch, I would definitely come back to Jean-George! Such an amazing dining experience that I will continue to cherish. WOW! is my reaction to this exquisite place. Came here to celebrate my girlfriends birthday w/ her daughter. All of us were amazed at how professional and synchronized the staff were. The food was also beautifully presented. Although if you plan to share, beware of making a mess since the plates have odd shapes. (sauces drips everywhere, lol)  They gave my lady a cute cholocate cake since it was her B-day too. Nice touch!  Very pricey, but for special occasions, worth every penny.  We will be back for sure. Came here for 2015 restaurent week. Main dish (salmon) is ok; like the warm chocolate cake for dessert. We made a reservation for lunch one Saturday when we were in NYC. We arrived before they opened and checked in to make sure we could be seated once the lunch service started. Our visit started off a little rocky as they forgot about us and we had to ask twice to be seated. However, they recovered nicely and brought over champagne to make up for the inconvenience. We also quickly forgot about the bumpy start once we tried our first and second course...the food was really incredible - a true culinary delight! This restaurant is stunningly beautiful too. Jean George's is a beautiful place with world class service. For my bday, the Misses decided to take me here. What else can I say that 1000 others haven't said on yelp?  How about how coordinated the servers were, timing when plates are set on the table and when they are taken away. The timing was as precise as a Michael Jackson choreography. Our main server explained each dish as they came, always had a smile on her face.  How about the little complimentary bites including the oyster, tuna bite, chestnut soup, refreshing palate cleanser (Apple, Passionfruit, raspberry sorbets), homemade marshmallows, macaroons and chocolates? For the ladies, don't forget the parting bag of chocolates.  We also chose the Pre-fix. 3 courses of light to heavy with a 4th course dessert.  Cauliflower scallop were really delicious. The sauce which was sweet and tangy which combined nicely with the lightly charred cauliflower and scallop.  Santa Barbara sea urchin was creamy and had Yuzu sauce. I thought the citrus flavor overpowered the sea urchin but she didn't think so.  Caramelized foie gras was probably the best dish of the night. The crispy Apple along with the perfectly cooked foie gras as excellent.  The hake with daikon was okay. Fish was beautifully cooked but I wasn't a big fan of the curry base. I think it was curry base. One of the servers were struggling to explain it and I couldn't understand him.  The suckling pork confit was okay. The picture looked better than the dish tasted. Perhaps we were a little full already but the crispy skin was still very good. Overall, the dining experience was fantastic and unique. Loved this place. Impeccable service! The waiters are like a choreographed dance team. The decor is beautiful with high ceiling and floor to ceiling windows. And the food is absolutely delicious and beautifully plated. Very formal so jacket is required for gents. Pricey and worth it. Would recommend and will be returning. Dinner for 4, Monday night 8:45PM seating. Literally one of the best fine dining experiences, EVER.  My six co-residents and I celebrated here and ordered the pre-fix dinner menu for a total of three items.  Here's what we ordered: Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons, Avocado, Spicy Radish and Ginger Marinade Foie Gras Brl, Rhubarb, Pineapple \"Raisins\" and Sichuan Peppercorns Black Sea Bass Crusted with Nuts and Seeds, Sweet and Sour Jus Crispy Confit of Suckling Pig, Baby Beets and Ginger Vinaigrette Sauted Hudson Valley Foie Gras, Caramelized Champagne Mango, Ginger Sea Trout and Oyster Tartare, Lemon, Horseradish and Chive Madai Sashimi, Muscat Grapes, Buttermilk Emulsion and Herbs My favorites were the suckling pig and the Sashimi. However, everything was done exceptionally well. I feel so lucky I got to eat here. It is one of the most memorable dining experiences in New York City.  For dessert, we spoiled ourselves with eight different desserts. The macaroons are delicious as well as the sorbet ice cream. We also got a little treat to go in the end. It was a wonderful dining experience and I am so happy I got to eat here. All I have to say about this place: If I can eat here every year, my life would be complete. The End. Great experience. My friends and I all prefer the appetizers over the Entrees.  -Egg caviar: luxury but well worth it  -Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons: the highlight of the course...beautiful presentation and refreshing flavor  -sauted veal scallopine: good but not special -crispy confit of suckling pig: very good Friendly service! Very quiet place, went with a friend. Their seasonal bass with tomato is kind of salty. I personally enjoyed the tuna tartare as appetizer. Chocolate cake is great! I figured I might as well get around with this review. I came here for lunch with a friend on a Sunday. It was amazing how packed the place was on a random Sunday--almost every seat in both dining rooms was filled. Given the fact that we went during prime brunch time plus the fact that it's Jean-George, I can't say that I'm too surprised. We got the two-course prefixe--I had the tuna ribbons and the red snapper, and for dessert, I finished with the caramel tasting menu. I also had the passion fruit-lime soda as a drink. All in all, service was fantastic--exactly what you would expect from a triple star spot. They spaced out all the meals very well and despite how crowded the restaurant was, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly every dish came out.  We started off with a trio of amuse-bouche--I can't remember exactly what it was, but everything was delicious! The soda was also an interesting mix of fruity flavors and an excellent drink to complement my meal.  In terms of the actual items we ordered, I was very happy with the tuna ribbons. Personally I felt as though there was a bit too much avocado and wasabi on the bottom, but what I was really pleasantly surprised to see was how much tuna I got. In all my years of ordering fish appetizers, I've literally never gotten so much tuna--I literally could have just subsisted on that first course as my full meal. The tuna is also cut in a pretty interesting way--they're not actual ribbons, rather, it's many thin strips of tuna nestled together to form a circular entity that's laid on this avocado/wasabi bed. The tuna itself was extremely fresh and spot on. The snapper was also delicious, though nothing particularly outstanding. It was served with celery which really freshened up the flavor of the snapper. Caramel dessert tasting at the end was super on point. I love the spun sugar that topped my \"floating island\" as it's described. The caramel dessert sampling consisted of salted caramel ice cream, floating island/vanilla anglaise/spun sugar, caramelized banana tart, crisp puff pastry/warm pastry cream. So good! All in all, for a triple Michelin, the price was great--it came out to be about $80 after tip. I was sufficiently full with delicious food and wonderful service. It's a four star for me since I liked it, but didn't find it to be outstandingly amazing or anything. Would consider returning as casual lunch, but I didn't find particularly impressive creativity oozing out of the dishes. The setting of the place is also lovely though--it's lit with natural light as all the walls are glass. Wonderful if the sun is out and shining, but I'm not sure how wonderful it would be in the dark. tldr; delicious, wonderful triple Michelin. better to come for lunch so you can get all the deliciousness for a very reasonable ($48 for two courses) price One of Jean-Georges Vongerichtgen's anchor properties in the United States, Jean-Georges has a serene, open feel that seems a bit out of place next to the classless, gaudy polished bronze lobby of the Trump building. Vongerichten himself has been an understudy to many of the most successful names in fine dining- Paul Bocuse, Paul Haeberlin at L'Auberge de L'Ill, among others. I enjoyed lunch there, and you get a huge amount of choice for not as much money as you'd spend at other similarly high-end restaurants. The wait staff are pervasive- they literally fill the room, waiting to scoop up a dish, refill a drink, or present a new course. The linens are crisp, bright white, and impeccably cleaned after each course. The space is formal- maybe a little too formal for some. The food was absolutely excellent, though not exactly filling. I was jonesing for a slice of pizza as I left. For a dorky, course-by-course description, I invite you to go here: Came for lunch and it was great. The prices are fine for what it is and the service is very good. Highly recommended. For more than a decade we've been coming here, and it remains our favorite restaurant in New York. The dining room is elegant and uncrowded, a rarity in the city. The food is delicate, complex, and constantly evolving. The best deal in the city is lunch at Jean George, where you can assemble your own multi-course meal or choose a tasting menu for a fraction of the price of dinner. The wine list pricing is excellent, and there is a nice selection of high quality wines by the glass or even half glass, making it easy to assemble your own wine pairings. Service is professional, friendly and knowledgable, and even though we're probably outnumbered by the staff, it never feels overwhelming, just perfect. I served the best meal I ever had in my life here. Special menu and nice service, they will offer you a small dish before you have your meal and dessert. And the waiters/waitresses will introduce every dishes in details before you have it. (Even though I don't know most of them but I still very appreciate that she did that with patience). Fabulous dishes and quiet environment for dinner, definitely the best place for dating/celebrating anniversary. Also this is a pricy restaurant, but absolutely worth to try it out.  (THEY HAVE MICHELIN THREE-STARS AWARDS AND AAA FIVE DIAMONDS AWARDS!) Three star restaurant. Jean Georges offers quality French food with very reasonable price. Compare to other three star restaurants, it is easier to make a reservation, and it is cheaper.  The food is as impressive as I thought. Waiter recommended suitable wine pairing. Especially like their chocolate desert, steak and diver scollops. Jean-Georges was good, but we wouldn't say anything spectacular for a Michelin restaurant. The ambiance was nice and the service very good, but a bit overwhelming at times. Kind of feels like you have to be on your best behavior, but that could have been just us:) We did the prix fixe dinner and a bottle of wine and spent around $600 USD. We expected a little more \"wow\" for the money, but it wasn't bad. Went their for my 1st anniversary dinner, the environment is cozy but too crowded. I feel like we can hear everyone talking, too much table!!! As an 3 star rated restaurant I'm disappointed for the food. The presentation of the food just can be more creative. We skip the Jean George's signature tasting menu, and go with the summer tasting menu,208ppl.  I'm not satisfy with the food they serve us with this high price. The food is tasty buy underwhelming, the best part of my entire dinner was the sorbet before petit four. The service is thoughtful and warm, really appreciated. The underwhelming dining experience starts with the amuse bouche, really don't like the carrot wrapped mozzarella. Then comes soft poached egg with caviar and yoghurt, it's tasty, but it's flat in flavor. The sashimi(Madai) is really good, material is fresh and the sauce perfectly matched the sauce. The green asparagus's sauce is way too strong, I would be more happy to just have the asparagus. For the Halibut with spiced broth, I just have to say I have had a better one in Caprice, Hong Kong.  Maine lobster with garlic and chili sauce, I feel like the sauce is bit too strong, because I ate the lobster by itself first and it's delicious! I like it a lot. But when I eat the sauce with it, the sauce is kind take over too much.  The strawberry tasting menu is a total failure of the night, either its appearance or taste, it's the food that will come out from the downstairs diner, not the 3-starred michelin restaurant.  I was expecting a lot from this restaurant. Disappointed. Ate here on a trip as a must eat restaurant. Jena-Georges did not disappoint. We ordered the 9 serving chef's tasting menu and every bite was over the top delicious. 9 course was more like 11 courses after the cheese tray, home made chocolates to go and the chef's random plate of 3 over top flavor bites. Eating here, I felt like a chef in the back was in constant competition to out do the other restaurants daily and with every diner.  Service was perfect and the waiter polite and informed. But don't ask or extra sauce, you'll get a squishy nose before they deliver. Came for lunch. What a great value to choose 2 dishes for $48 and any additional dish is a $24 supplement. It's like building your own tasting menu to as much or as little food as you want. Started with 3 amuse bouches. All fantastic and packed with so much flavor. I'd say the best way to dine here is to just ask the waitress what the chef's signature dishes are - and then order those. We ended up getting Tuna Ribbons, Diver Scallops, Black Bass Crusted with Nuts and Seeds, Sauteed Veal Scallopine, and Crispy Confit of Suckling Pig. All were delicious and I would get them again, but if I was forced to rank them, the Sauteed Veal Scallopine would be my #1. And I'm usually not a veal person! Exceptional service and friendly. I also saw some folks in dressy jeans and sneakers. Guess they are slightly more lax at lunch. Brought my family as was worried that they might not have the best experience (they don't really go to fancy tasting menu restaurants). Boy was I wrong - they loved it and our waiter/the kitchen was 100% perfect when my mother requested some small modifications. Bring someone who has never had a tasting menu before and they will love it! I attribute my first fine dining experience in New York to a meal at JGV's Nougatine, the sister (and lesser) restaurant to Restaurant Jean Georges located next door in the Trump Tower. At the time, I wasn't aware of the dining room that was only a few yards away from me; after all, how could a just-transplanted Philadelphian know what three Michelin stars, four NY Times stars, and a 28 in Zagat meant? But it was the first step down the rabbit hole, and nearly two years later, with a respectable list of culinary conquests under my belt, there was something fitting about walking through the same doors - but this time, for Jean-Georges. Arriving earlier in the day or evening will afford a gorgeous view of Central Park West, as the floor-to-ceiling windows across the room let the remainder of sunlight filter in throughout the evening. The dining room, almost as iconic as the restaurant's name, consists of numerous curved banquette-style seats bordering a handful of perfectly-spaced tables. It's modern elegance at its best: comfortable, but still grand enough to let guests know they aren't in any ordinary dining room. For dinner, Jean Georges offers a three course prix-fixe as well as two tasting menus: the Signature and the Seasonal. Both are comprised of 7 courses, and despite multiple perusals of the menu, both had dishes so tempting that I couldn't decide between the two. Thankfully, our server was able to confirm that we could interchange courses between the two tastings, which solved my dilemma. A half-bottle of Zilliken 2011, a slightly dry Riesling, was brought out, and we were presented with a variety of light, summery amuses, signifying the start of the meal. To begin, the signature Egg Caviar. Even at first glance, it's a dichotomous dish; a simple egg shell almost comically topped with a generous spoonful of caviar. The hollowed egg shell is filled with a fluffy, almost airy soft scramble of eggs which is then finished off by whipped cream and caviar. Each spoonful is pure delight; the hints of cayenne in the scrambled egg are perfectly offset by the addition of lemon in the whipped cream, and the final punch is delivered by the brininess of caviar. My only regret was that there wasn't slightly more of it, but it served as a good segue into the second course. I was surprised at the size of the Sea Scallops as they were less than a centimeter in width, but they were lightly seared and served with caramelized cauliflower, a few strands of parsley, and a nutmeg-infused caper-raisin emulsion.  The Young Garlic Soup that followed was served in two parts: a small terrine for the soup and a side of sauted frog legs, which I was encouraged to use my fingers to pick up and dip into the soup. I did appreciate the simplicity in the garlic soup, which was delightfully aromatic with the addition of thyme, curled watercress, and chive blossoms, but the discombobulated components threw me off. The Turbot that followed was perfectly poached and tender, but the pairing with a Chteau Chalon Sauce made it significantly less appetizing. The sauce, made from the rarer yellow Chteau Chalon wine, had a strong acidic edge that overpowered the fish. This was slightly ameliorated by the Lobster Tartine, which consisted of butter-poached lobster served with pea shoots and snap peas, finished tableside with a pour of the lemongrass and fenugreek broth. The presence of the butter toast at the bottom of the bowl was confusing at best, as it only become a soggy carbohydrate in short time, but the lobster was cooked to perfection, and the broth was startlingly simple and balanced meld of lobster stock, tomato, lemongrass, and fenugreek. The final savory course featured a perfectly-executed Lamb Chop, seared to a medium-rare and paired with a chili oil and cucumber yogurt. The protein was delicious, both fatty and lean, and the contrast of spice and coolness worked in tandem. Dessert is an essential ending to any good meal, and the tasting menus at JG offer a quartet of Dessert Tastings. The Strawberry Tasting was less than memorable, with a strawberry-red wine sorbet, over a vanilla crumble; a tasteless sponge cake, paired with a caramelized balsamic meringue; an effort at chantilly cream that clashed with the addition of shiso syrup; and a room-temperature Pte  Choux, served with a side of Strawberry Jam. The better bet is to stick with the Chocolate tasting, which offers a miniature version of JGV's signature molten chocolate cake. I must caveat this review with the fact that: yes, I am biased, no, I am not a professional, and yes, this is based on just one experience out of many. But let the main takeaway be this: Jean Georges continues to deliver high quality food and service, in a remarkable ambiance. Is it the best of the best? In my opinion, no, but it's a worthy presence in the list of NYC's (and the nation's) best restaurants. -- Review #101 of 2014: Complete. I came here during Easter weekend for brunch with an old friend I hadn't seen in a while, and neither of us had dined here before. We both had high expectations due to the restaurant's reputation, and we both agreed afterwards that it was a great dining experience. My friend commented numerous times how hospitable the servers were. The food was very good but I was not WOWed as I was hoping for. I ordered the goat cheese gnocchi and the crusted sea bass, while my friend had the sea urchin and organic chicken. The presentation of all four dishes were beautiful. I think maybe I just had too high expectations and maybe I need to return for dinner for the full dining experience. Or maybe the dishes I ordered weren't unique enough for me to be wowed. The dining room is beautiful during the daytime though, with the natural sunlight seeping in through the huge windows. Am definitely looking forward to returning for a special occasion 5 stars from me!! Truthfully the food was probably a 4.5, but when considering the service and the pricing....it's only fair to round up to 5! I spent a while researching places to eat in NYC as we were only in town for one night. I already had my heart set on a particular restaurant but decided to wait for another trip as it was going to be $$$$ and the trip itself already wasn't cheap.  After extensive yelp research I settled on Jean-Georges as the lunch pricing just can't be beat when comparing all of the high-end NYC chefs. I made the reservation a month in advance...as early as Open Table let me, just to be safe. When we ate (12:15pm on a Saturday) the restaurant was only 75% full so don't panic if you haven't made your reservation yet, you'll probably be ok.  LOCATION Jean-Georges is located in the Trump building on the South-West corner of Central Park. Great location for strolling in the park afterwards.  SERVICE I've eaten at many high-end restaurants but the service here was above many. Servers brought plates and took away plates in unison which showed how well trained they were. Servers walked around with bread baskets offering the different selections. Crumbs were consistently cleared from the table and waters constantly filled. Honestly I spent the time between courses just watching the servers work together like a well oiled machine.  FOOD/DRINK Steven and myself opted to start with cocktails. He tried the Thai Ricky which was rum based drink with thai chili peppers. I tried a sparkling cocktail with strawberry which came recommended by our server.  There is a tasting menu offered for lunch here, but we didn't have time or the hunger to do the 6 courses. Instead we opted to do the 2 course lunch for $48 each and added a little on. Amuse Bouche -  *Compressed watermelon with thai chili - superb! *Raspberry gazpacho - very tasty *Corn fritter with chipotle mayo - honestly the BEST fritter of my life. So light and airy..I'm convinced I'll never find another fritter to compare.  For our first round we had * Diver sea scallops - I felt the caper-raisin emulsion didn't work for me, but the scallops were cooked to perfection. *Tuna ribbons - pretty sure Steven wanted to kiss the chef. Best tuna of his life he said. *Fried sweetbreads - we added on this dish and I'm so glad we did as this was my favorite item. The peach complimented the dish perfectly and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  For our second round we had * Sauteed Veal - the ham made the dish a bit salty for me, but the mushrooms were heavenly. * Confit of Suckling Pig - amazing! Even the aromas coming off of the plate were amazing.  Unfortunately we were too full to order a dessert, but did manage to squeeze in the macarons, chocolates and house-made marshmallows that came with the check. The macarons were extremely well made as were the chocolates. All of those who gave JG rave reviews apparently haven't dined in true Michelin 3 star restaurant. Sorry JG, but you lost your touch. Out of 14 dishes between JG tasting and the Summer menus only a handful of them were worthy some stars, but even those involved caviar and lobster - ingredients hard to mess up. Sauce in charred corn raviolis was unbearably over salted, halibut - dry and chewy, garlic soup and frog legs - again over salted and flavorless. I could go on, but the point is - we've been coming to JG for years and always had very good memories, but all good things must come to an end, so has JG. Too bad. Our wedding anniversary dinner was a true downer. Au revoir Jo Jo, we are not coming back. I had a turkey entree and the taste of it was just unbearable. I tried to make myself eat it, not to upset my husband, who is a big fan of Jean-Georges. But I could not even swallow it. I could not say that the dish was burned, or not fresh or that something else was objectively wrong with it. It just tasted really bad both the turkey and the stuffing. It was surprising to me, as I have never had any strong dislikes, and would eat pretty much everything. I thought that my taste must be not sophisticated enough to appreciate this experience.  Our waitress came by and seeing my almost untouched plate offered to take it to go. I politely declined. She asked \"why not\", I just shrugged my shoulders. Then she asked if I did not like it. I said: \"not really\". She apologized and asked if I wanted something else. At first I said no, but as she kept insisting, I started considering it, since I was pretty hungry. But my husband said that everything was fine.  I left hungry and upset. While I appreciated being offered something else (I assume they were not going to charge us for replacement) I was still disappointed to have gotten something that bad in a reputable restaurant. Apart from it, we were not asked how everything was when we just started. By the time the waitress came by, my husband had finished his entree and was waiting for the desert. If I was to accept a different entree it would delay us significantly. My appetizer and desert were good, but not enough even for someone, who does not eat much. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I've been coming here for years for mostly special celebrations and the food and service has never disappointed. JG has a pretty solid lunch prix-fixe option as well that is significantly cheaper than their normal prices. Some of my go to dishes are their yellowfin tuna ribbons, black bass and sweetbreads! Jean George gets full five stars because it is \" customers friendly\". Unlike other snobby michelin starred establishments that intend to pretend how popular and hard to get a seat in last min, Jean George same day reservation makes me happy already before he feeds my tummy. Located at trump international hotel in Columbus circle, Jean George is easy access for ACED and 1 train line. Hate the hassle from open table credit card reservation? It's much easier just call them and the receptionist didn't even mention about credit card.  Impeccable lunch deal for $44 two course ( appetizer and entree ). Optional for $28 per additional dish and $12 for assorted dessert. Dinner prix fix starts from $128 for three course. Had lunch with mom this afternoon and it was lovely, starting from amuse-bouche to petit four. I had Santa Barbara uni with yuzu sauce, finishing with jalapeo and sea salt and with crunchy bread in the bottom. Love the combination of sea urchin and the crunchy bread, however the sourness of yuzu sauce overwhelmed the natural sweetness of uni. A bite of sourness, sweetness, spiciness and saltiness. My mom had foie gras brulee with dried cranberries and candied pistachios. Loved the richness and smoothness of foie gras mixed with crunchy pistachios. My entree was beef tenderloin, spinach and gruyere crepe ( additional $20 supplement ). It's a lighter edition of steak compare to buttery American steaks. I love the fact there is no burns on the tenderloin's skin, which causes cancer and other disease. Spinach and gruyere crepe with steak was a genius idea compare to greasy mashed potato and buttered spinach. My mom had crispy confit suckling pig as entree. The meat was braised to tender and juicy with the pig skin seared to transparent on the top and with some blood puddings. Two corse were fulfilling but we have another stomach for desserts as always. Jean George offer quartet of dessert sets. Chocolate, caramel, citrus and winter. Each theme provides four different kinds of petit desserts course. I am a sucker for caramel and Jean George's dessert execution was memorable. Salted caramel ice cream, floating island with vanilla anglaise, caramelized banana tart and crispy puff pastry. Perfect mouth full size desserts of each kinds.  The service was impeccable and attentive. Waiters were always in the same melody to take our plates away. Patience and delightful to introduce us the ingredients of each course. I will defiantly come back to try more and recommend this restaurant to my friends. I am surprised that I have not updated my review of this marquee outpost of the venerable French chef, or should I say, business magnate, having been there for several recruiting breakfasts (most candidates accepted) and celebratory dinners. The setting is very 'Midtown New York fine dining', with its fair share of Europeans in black, tourist couples splurging to celebrate, and slick salespeople looking to close on a deal but constrained by the deal size or their expense budget or their level of access from going to Per Se instead. There is a variety of menus and options. The dinner menu has prix fixe options for a three-course plus dessert meal or a more pricey assortment of the chef's signature dishes. The wine list is fit-for-purpose, with the multi-thousand dollar bottles listed simply to tempt unsuspecting bankers and wooers into indulgences they would likely regret over time. But I digress. I quite like the goat cheese with beets and pistachios. And the parsnip soup with a hint of coconut and lime. The chef is flexible with devising dishes that are just to your liking, generally with an Asian touch to the customization, perhaps in part from his memories of running Vong? The menu keeps changing and I don't go frequently enough to judge how frequently adjustments are made. Where Jean-Georges always leaves a memorable impression is with its desserts. To use a Yelp clich, \"pick your poison\"--citrus, chocolate or caramel, and you get to pick a number of options under that category. Their salted caramel ice cream is superb, and so is the warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream. Most dessert items are stand outs, so pick with abandon but exercise care to leave room for dessert as you masticate on your entre. If I had large sums of money and equally easy access to seating, I would prefer Per Se over Jean-Georges. Or even Daniel over Jean-Georges. But I will certainly return here from time to time. We came here for dinner on Saturday night and sat in the main dining room. There are only 2 ways to eat here- 3 course or 7 course tasting menu. We ordered the 3 course tasting menu. They provided a few complimentary mini courses on top so it ended up feeling like the 7 course menu! After the bread, they provided a complimentary plate to open our palates- carpaccio with mozzarella, split pea with avocado and a strawberry gazpacho- delicious!  For the first course, I got the diver scallops(7/10)- they were really good, but not as good as the yellowfin tuna ribbons (10/10). For the middle course, I got the peekytoe crab dumplings- these were AMAZING! (10/10). The Gulf Shrimp and smoked bacon was also good (8/10). For the main course, we got the sea bass crusted with nuts- Very good (8/10) and also the lamb chops (8/10). We were then brought out another palate cleanser- little tartlets- blueberry, strawberry and passion fruit. For dessert, you pick a theme and you are brought an assortment of desserts related to that theme- we went with chocolate but there was also caramel, cherry and strawberry. Everything was delicious. Then as an extra treat, we were brought a silver tray with some extra little dessert tastings and vanilla bean marshmallows. They also gave me a little bag with some truffles as a to-go gift- such a great touch! Overall we left feeling very satisfied. Definitely a pricey place but impeccable service and delicious food in a great atmosphere! The service was a choreography of attention. The food was spectacular. The space and dishes elegant. I might need a better date next time (my husband of 30 years was a little annoying and kept saying, \"people will think you're from Omaha if you snap a photo of that {gorgeous goat cheese gnocchi with crispy artichoke and lemon oil}.\") He's not much of a foodie but he's good in the sack. I guess I can't have it all unless I go to Jean Georges. Of all the Michelin Starred restaurants I have been to, Jean Georges is so classically elegant and refined I can't give it anything less than 5 stars.  The food is clean, fresh, and inviting. Playful flavors that may hit the wrong note at times, but overall the plates are consistent.  The service is the best I've experienced. From French Laundry to Alinea, the staff here was so inviting, proper and well managed I was simply astounded. They don't serve you based on your appearance, but they serve you because you are there and they want to provide you with the best experience even though you've under packed for your New York trip and are wearing an inappropriately casual maxi dress. They are there before you look for them, they don't pull the chair, they pull the table out for you. I've never experience such wonderful service as I have at Jean Georges and for that I give them 5 stars - it's not just the restaurant, it's the experience. Of everything that I had at Jean Georges, I would have to note that their contrast for texture is astounding. The delicate crunch of some sort of nut crumble paired with a creamy dollop of veggie puree. I didn't even know what I was eating and I sort of didn't care. I was so focused on the flavors, the contrasts, and trying to process it all that I couldn't even pay attention to anything else. The foie gras and granola was oddly sweet to me - but all the fish/seafood plates were phenomenal.  I will definitely be back. Hell, I would have my wedding here if it were financially feasible. - Recommend After sitting on hold with a voicemail bot telling me I had only one minute to hold, for 15 minutes, the reservationists who FINALLY answered the phone said they have no reservations available at all for the duration of time I am in NYC. This is my question- if that is the case then have a recorded black out date announcement rather than having someone sit on hold for so long only to be told no. Certainly at these prices they could afford such courtesies.  Not sure if I will try again. Had an early dinner here on a Saturday. This place was amazing, no wonder it has three Michelin stars. The decor was very clean and sophisticated. The service was also top notch.  To start I had the foie gras Creme Brle. It was one of the most delicious foie gras dishes I had ever eaten. I could've had it again for my main course then dessert!  I had the crab risotto next which was also very good. For the entree I had the lamb. It looked great but it tasted even better. I ended the meal with the caramel dessert which was also amazing.  This place is definitely worth the hype. Perhaps I have become a food snob having dined at three Michelin stared Gordon Ramsey in London in March, a variety of two Michelin stared French restaurants in April, and Ichimura at Brushstroke last night, but Jean-George was the biggest fine dining disappointment of my life. While the service was friendly and warm, which I appreciated greatly, the food was by far the worst of any Michelin rated restaurant I have experienced in the past five years. In the middle of the meal, I actually thought that it would be better to leave and grab a slice at a local pizza place.  Each course was overpowered by a richly intense dressing that distracted the palate from the essence of the primary and focused ingredients. My brain was perplexed by each combination of each course and felt no solace or even excitement by what was being processed in my brain through my sense of fragrance or taste.  I don't want exhaust this review with the details of each course's disappointment, but I would recommend that anyone consider an alternative. Having lived in Manhattan before in my younger years, never having afforded the opportunity to dine in such an exquisite place, I was beyond disappointed having selected NYC as a weekend retreat instead of heading to Paris for a few days. The sea bass is the most excellent thing I have ever eaten, their pre fix is very reasonably priced, the dessert tasting menu is also a steal, very chic ambiance, excellent for business lunch or romantic date My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our 2nd Valentine's Day and 1st Anniversary! Thanks to JG offer us great lunch and awesome service. We love the special anniversary dessert a lot! I was a bit skeptical about having to walk into a Trump tower near Central Park, but Jean-Georges exceeded my expectations. This place is definitely worthy of the 3 Michelin stars.  This fine dining restaurant does not disappoint. The elegant decor and beautiful, well-trained staff make for an atmosphere that is high class, without being too stuffy. It was too classy of a place for me to pull out my camera; but trust me, the presentation was delicate and beautiful. I love the organic shape of the dishes the food is presented in. More importantly, each dish was a unique combination of flavors that worked superbly together.  Portions are rather small, but sufficient because of their richness and complexity. My favorite amuse bouche of any restaurant, Jean-Georges delivers a trio to awaken your tastebuds- a bright raw fish on rice cracker to a west coast oyster and foam, followed by a rich, beefy soup with a miniature ravioli. The crab dumpling was an excellent fusion of East and West. The foie gras was creamy and decadent, served with a topping of cherries and citrus gelee was so masterful. Currently, they have a delightful handmade pasta with fresh shaved truffles from Italy.  Every meal ends with a delicious assortment of sweets. The housemade vanilla marshmallows are delightful.  Well priced wines by the glass, excellent service, and amazing food makes me a fan. There are a lot of great restaurants in NYC, but Jean-Georges will be one that will be on our regular rotation when we visit. One of the absolute best dining experiences we've had, on the same level as French Laundry. The star of my meal was five grams of fresh Alba Truffle shaved over an incredibly simple pasta with butter sauce and a touch of lemon zest. The flavors were a beautiful symphony, elegant in its simplicity and bold in its confidence. The wine selections were fantastic, and the \"taste\" portions are quite generous. Service was admirably efficient, polite, informative, and friendly. WOW! Jean Georges clearly doesn't need another stellar review but here goes. This place is one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Located in the Trump International Towers, the restaurant has a beautiful bar and interior. Simple, very classy.  The food at Jean Georges is excellent, exquisite, spectacular. The standouts for me were the sesame crusted foie gras and the black sea bass. Amazing. The service was spot-on, as expected. We got a nice booth seat for two in a part of the restaurant that kind of caves in a little. If you like fine dining, this place is a must. You won't regret it! We did the $118 pre fix dinner menu and we were STUFFED by the end of the meal. You won't leave hungry. TIP: The dessert course (which comes with the pre fixe) is included and it is large. Save room! I had pretty high expectations for Jean-Georges as I love Nougatine, the sister restaurant. We came here for the two plate tastes of winter lunch menu. I got there late and my friends were seated at the table already. It was nice they didn't make them wait in the bar area. I really liked the amuse bouche we got at the beginning of the meal. For my appetizer, I had the foie gras brule, which was impressive and delicious. My friend got the tuna ribbons, which she enjoyed. For entree, I had the roast suckling pig, which was good but I quickly tired of the flavor. My friend didn't love her sweetbreads, but I thought the artic char was better. For dessert, we shared the chocolate and caramel tastings, as well as the chef's special of the poached pear. The chocolate was the best as nothing can beat that warm chocolate JG cake. I also liked the selection of petit fours at the end of the meal, but I've seen more appealing options at other restaurants. Service was lovely and attentive, but at the end of the meal, JG just didn't match up to my experiences at Nougatine or Bouley. Dinner at Jean Georges is more than just a fancy pants meal that will require you to take out a loan or sell an organ in order to afford. It's a memorable, impressive and special dining experience that will knock your socks off... and your fancy pants too. Our group of six celebrated my little bro's 30th birthday here with a wine-paired tasting menu. Each course was presented beautifully, tasted lovely and service was perfectly orchestrated. Every need was anticipated, and done with such grace and flawlessness. For a 3-star Michelin rated restaurant, I was expecting to find a dining room adorned with chandeliers made from diamonds and baby otter lined chairs. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find a bright, simple, yet tasteful dining room with no traces of an endangered species. Such a special place to celebrate and mark an occasion to remember! Great experience here.  Kudos for their affordable lunch tasting - $48 for 2 courses (app & entre). It's $24 for each additional plate. Portions are a decent size plus they give you bread (they offered multiple times) as well as amuse-bouches and some chocolates/marshmallows after your meal. So you will be fed!  Service was excellent.  The space itself is really nice - high ceilings, high windows that reflect the trees outside in such a way that it almost looks planned. A lot of light in the dining room during the day - it sets a really nice atmosphere.  The lunch tasting menu had a lot of great-sounding options. FYI - they had another lunch tasting menu (more plates and more money). I had the trout & oyster tartar to start - which was great and it came with this fantastic buttery/salty rye bread. For my entre, I had the arctic char - very good but almost too rich and fatty tasting. It came with a rather sweet parsnip puree with honey on top, felt that was too much sweetness for my taste buds. My co-worker really enjoyed the meal as well - she had the butternut squash soup that she was raving about. For dessert - they offer a small tasting menu by theme. $12 a plate. We chose caramel and it came with 3 or 4 different items. Everything was super delicious!  We had a rough time at work after - we were so full and I was super dehydrated from the saltiness and we both kept almost falling asleep. We usually both eat small portions of healthy food so the richness of all this hit us hard but it was worth it! Came for lunch. Great value as you choose 2 dishes for $48 and any additional dish is a $24 supplement. They started us with 3 great amuse bouches. Very knowledgeable staff and they recommended excellent dishes . She suggested Tuna Ribbons, Diver Scallops, Black Bass Crusted with Nuts and Seeds, Sauteed Veal Scallopine, and Crispy Confit of Suckling Pig. All were delicious and I would get them again, but if I was forced to rank them, I really liked the Crispy Confit of Suckling Pig.  Great wine pairing suggestions, thanks! A little disappointed. Expected more given the Michelin stars, but found the food only ok. Don't know if its worth the price. Was really looking forward to the experience. We had the 7 course Prix fixe tasting menus, and ended up liking the amuse bouche the best. Frog legs were very salty, a few of the dishes actually were. Half of the items served did not match what was listed in the menu. I was supposed to get a scallop dish but got some kind of sushi instead. At one point I was even served wine I didn't order, then it was taken from the table, being told it was a mistake, then offered the glass compliments of the house as an after thought. I refused it, but felt like that shouldn't happen in such a renowned establishment. The seafood dishes were only ok. Actually preferred seafood at the now closed Fulton in the upper east side. Don't get me wrong, service was good over all, and food was also not bad. Just didn't live up to the expectations. My spouse and I dined at Jean Georges for Sunday lunch in July 2012. We had looked forward to eating at this Michelin 3-star restaurant for years, but we were only satisfied (not awed) with our experience. Our Sunday lunch reservation was not difficult to obtain, made easier by booking through Open Table. Although jackets are required for dinner, they were optional for Sunday lunch. When we arrived at 11:30 am for our 11:45 am reservation, we were told that they did not begin seating until precisely 11:45, and we were directed to wait in either the Trump Hotel lobby (which was smallish and very busy, probably because it was check-out time), the bar at Nougatine (which was full), or the outdoor patio at Nougatine (which looked lovely; however, the weather was steamy, hot, and humid). We elected to wait in the hotel lobby, along with two other couples who were also waiting to be seated. We weren't offered drinks as we sat in the lobby; however, someone did come to fetch us at 11:45 when our table was ready, which was a pleasant surprise; we thought that we would be forgotten and have to present ourselves again to the hostess desk. The Jean Georges restaurant is attractive, with stark white modern decor, high ceilings, and three walls of windows; however, you must traipse through casual \"little sister\" restaurant Nougatine to enter; on Sunday at 11:45, it seemed that all the hotel guests were present having breakfast. The doors between the two restaurants remained open the entire time of the lunch service, so the Jean Georges setting was less than serene. To compound things, we were seated at the front corner of the room, and although the table position gave us a great view of Jean Georges, it also allowed the noise and commotion from Nougatine to color our dining experience. A service stand was positioned right next to our table, so servers were constantly stopping there to enter orders and pick up/put back wine bottles and water pitchers. I'm not sure that there is an ideal table in this space; several service stands surround the room, and some of the tables are a bit close together. One table for two was tucked into an alcove; a nice, private spot except for the table immediately fronting it. The dining room appears to hold approximately 50 or so guests, at tables for parties of 2, 4, and 6. Two menu options are available for lunch - a 6-course tasting for $128 (set menu without choices), or a 2-course menu for $38 (with several choices from each of three categories); with the 2-course menu, additional course are available for $19 and dessert is available for $12. For the 2-course menu, certain dishes such as egg caviar, foie gras, white asparagus, and scallops come with a supplemental price. We chose the 6-course tasting menu, and were mostly happy. We (and all diners, even those with the 2-course menu) started with a 3-part amuse-bouche of a shooter of popcorn soup, a cube of marinated watermelon topped with feta cheese, and a sort of pickle slice. Next came an egg custard topped with caviar and complemented by a basil sauce. We also dined on yellowtail ribbons with avocado and radish, ravioli with peas and tomatoes, skate with spring vegetables, and rack of lamb with a chili sauce. All the dishes were beautifully presented, and the ingredients were delicious; however, the accompaniments for the skate and the lamb were absolutely redundant in both appearance and taste. The cherry dessert tasting was amazing, with four components - a sort of deconstructed black forest cake, cherries jubilee, crme brle, and sorbet. Following dessert, we received chocolate mignardises and the Jean Georges signature homemade vanilla bean marshmallows. Service was acceptable, with some servers clearly having a better handle on things than others. One of our wait staff appeared to just be learning, and she cleared our bread plates and glasses much sooner than they should have been. We felt that the beverage service was a bit slow, and our glasses were often empty (which is surprising - if they had offered more drinks, they would have made more money). Our lunch was not perfect, but it was a good meal with decent service at a fair price (when you compare its price with the other Michelin 3-stars in town like Per Se and Masa). The prix fixe dinner was excellent. The restaurant is very clean and the service was customer focused and attentive. I loved the food and wine here and felt that my overall dining experience and food palette has changed for the better thanks to the quality of food here. It also has a gorgeous view through the large glass windows.  To start they offer you their house bread with a couple of options on what type of bread you would like. We started off with the amuse-bouche from the chef. Then we moved onto their signature dish of caviar with creme fraiche and meyer lemon. Next, we feasted on their abalone and then asparagus with cream sauce. After that we were served a fish dish and succeeding that was a lobster dish and radishes served four ways. We also had the duck breast. For dessert, we had the sorbet, assorted mini desserts and marshmallows. The food goes great with wine. When we are away on vacation, we try not to splurge too much on fancy restaurant since frankly with airfares, hotels and some shopping, it gets quite costly. But as a foodie, I am always tempted to try some tasting menu here and there but this time we travel with 2 friends, so we hold back. So what came closest, is a $38 two-course lunch at Jean Georges (@Jean_GeorgesNYC), a three Michelin Star restaurant. I have been here once for their lunch a few years ago and was totally impress, so we just had to come back. While the dinner menu features a three-course meal at $118 and a tasting menu at $198, this was definitely a deal. Great way to get a taste of their yummy fares and amazing service. The atmosphere was elegant with white tablecloths, high ceiling and large windows overlooking Central Park. Amuse Bouche ~ Parsnip w/ Coconut Milk & Lime Foam + Fluke on Black Truffle Toast + Duck Dumpling ~ This amuse bouche trio was amazing especially the soup/foam which was very refreshing and open up our palate plus it was complimentary.  Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons, Avocado and Spicy Raddish, Ginger Marinade  ~The fish was very fresh and tender served over a creamy avocado but I thought the soy ginger marinade drizzle table side was a tad salty but love the kick from the drops of chili oil that float on top.  ~ Amazing presentation, almost like a pasta dish. Sea Trout Draped in Trout Eggs, Lemon and Olive Oil ~ The lemon mouse here was rather tart which we love, perfect with the salty trout eggs Hamachi Sashimi, Avocado, Yuzu Radish ~ This was probably my least favorite dish, although love the presentation and the Hamachi was very fresh but it was nothing to write home about. Nishiki Risotto with Peekytoe Crab, Nori and Key Lime ~ Rather bland looking but this was really tasty with the big chucks of crab meat. Although the previous 3 appetizers was cold and rather refreshing, this was very hearty and had a heavier taste. Crispy Confit of Suckling Pig, Rutabaga \"Pudding\" and Smoked Bacon Marmalade ($10 Supplement) ~ Pulled pork shaped into a rectangle, love how a hearty dish look so dainty and pretty. Almost look like dessert.  ~ The skin on top was super crispy and the meat was moist and flavorful. ~ I also make sure to get a bit of the pudding and the marmalade with each bite, the flavors just complimented each other so well. Licorice Braised Sweetbreads, Baby Carrot, Ginger and Shiitake Mushrooms ~ I was totally tempted to order this but was afraid that the licorice taste would be very strong but it actually was very subtle.  ~ Although it was plated table side, the presentation still manage to look pretty good. ~ The sweetbread was served table side and love how every one of our dish came at the same time. Sauteed Veal Scallopine, Flying Pig Ham, Mushrooms and Lavender ~ Not a huge fan of veal but I did love the mushroom toppings. Caramel $12 ~ Caramelized Pineapple Sorbet, Passion Fruit, Brioche ~ Creme Caramel, Maple, Bacon and Pecan Powder ~ Peanut Torte, Caramel Mousse,Brown Butter Caramel ~ Only one of us decided to order dessert but of course each of us end up getting a bite. I am surprise that it was a rather good portion and a deal at $12 at a place like this Even if you skip dessert, there was still something sweet for you to end your meal. There was complimentary fluffy vanilla bean marshmallow. nougat, truffles, fruit jelly and macarons Verdict : ~ Amazing Food and Amazing Service ~ An affordable way to try a three Michelin Star Restaurant, lunch is the way to go. ~ Only $39 for a two-course lunch menu with an extensive choices ~ Plus complimentary amuse bouche and petite fours My husband and I ate here this past June. The food was good, not great, the service by the waiter was horrible! Not only did he treat my husband and I less than par, but also the couples at the surrounding tables. I don't ask for much, but please do not treat the customers like they are a bother. The one shinning point was a wonderful busboy, who I had no problem slipping a $100 too. He was amazing and was very appreciative...even to the point as to say my tip to him was too much. My only regret was not to get the young mans name. My husband and I went to Jean George for lunch during our most recent trip to NYC. It was a great experience. The speciality cocktail list was so inventive and fresh. We both had the \"Taste of Spring\" and my husband added a course. I had the glazed potatoes with caviar and the confit of suckling pig. My husband had a shrimp appetizer, a wild sea trout appetizer, the sea bass entree. We had the chocolate and caramel desserts. The staff at Jean George was very approachable. We had a great experience. I rarely rave about good service, but this may be best service I have ever received from a restaurant - and most importantly, it all felt genuine. I usually find service at fine dining restaurants to be a bit suffocating or their judging eyes make me feel a bit self conscious. I felt neither of these at Jean Georges. We were treated with impeccable service as soon as we walked in, even though we were almost half an hour late. We came here on a Thursday for lunch to celebrate for a birthday and boy was it the perfect spot. The lunch prix fixe was so worth it. I called weeks ahead to let them know I was celebrating for a birthday. I didn't have to remind anyone the day of, my waiter knew right away when we sat down and asked if we wanted to celebrate with champagne.  By the end of our meal, they surprised my guy with their complimentary signature birthday chocolate dessert shaped in a gift box with a candle. It was a really nice gesture they do for their diners. Throughout our meal, we were surprised with other delightful complimentary bites (not birthday related, Jean Georges is just awesome). They start you off with three small bites as appetizers and finish your meal with an assorted varieties of marshmallows and other mini sweet treats. Between that and the birthday chocolate we very much regretted ordering additional dessert. the wait staff was so perfectly coordinated as a team, every plate that left or entered our table space was orchestrated in synchronized motions by two people. It was amazing.  I haven't even gotten to the food yet! Although, to no surprise it also exceeded my expectations. Appetizers: Ribbon bluefin tuna: the long ribbon cut was truly unique, and of course the tuna melted in your mouth. Foie gras: deliberately a bit burnt, gave it a smokey taste. I think I would've preferred it to be less burnt, but still quite good. Entrees: Blackened sea bass - crispy skin, flakey meat. It was perfect! Suckling pig - such crispy skin also! The beets made the presentation stand out. Dessert: We chose the caramel platter. By this time we were so full, we only managed to take one bite out of each of the three. It was delicious! Overall, I would not hesitate to come back here again and I would very much recommend this for any special occasion. Highly recommend Jean-Georges for lunch! $38 for two courses, $19 for any additional course? It's a three star Michelin steal to me! Although their menu may come across a little Asian inspired, it's all sophisticatedly done which really surprised me. Complex, but still simple and smooth and very very harmonic! It's tough getting that with all the other city Michelin competitors. The service was a little obscure when we went. My boyfriend and I had a feeling one of our servers was fresh meat; he was a little awkward and clumsy when it came to place down new silverware, and at one point almost knocked down my water glass with this cuff. 4.5.  It's definitely not the best experience overall, but the food and value is all the reason to go here. I found a fish bone in my Madai Sashimi ***gasps*** and mentioned it to our main server. He was very apologetic and offered to bring another plate; I told him no, it wasn't necessary, afterall, i found it in my last bite. In all honestly, we're all human, I did not care. Plue, when are you ever going to find a restaurant with a balanced package at a high end scale? Those are a gem to find. An absolutely special dining experience.  The restaurant is elegantly furnished and is very soft shades of grey and white, with stunning views of the park. The wait staff could not be more accommodating and pleasant. I had chosen to be adventurous and try the sweetbreads for the first time. I had a few bites and it was prepared very well, but it's just not for everyone. Our waiter noticed that I wasn't eating and he quickly offered me a new entree without any question. The meal was truly memorable and I cannot wait to come back. Just another notch on my Michelin-starred belt, thank you very much.  My fianc and I did the six-course tasting menu and left a wee bit underwhelmed. The service was amazing and the mood just right, but the food was average at best. Nothing stood out, nothing impressed us, and frankly, we actually left hungry after six courses. Go figure. I've had my more than my fair share of Michelin dining experiences, so it's not like I'm blindly reviewing Jean-Georges without some sense of what to expect from haute cuisine. If I'm gonna spend $600 on a dinner for 2, I better be blown away. Overall, the food was overly salted and overcooked. I suspect the lunch may be a better deal. Delicious veal with a savory sauce and great mushrooms on top. The waiters wore suits even the females so it had a very formal vibe to the whole place. I thought it was very fancy though you can get the same fanciness at places like perry steakhouse for a lot cheaper price. My wife had the sea bass which she thought was better than le bernadine and was very good. I would recommend this to anyone. What an amazing experience! Every little detail here does not go unnoticed.  A group of 3 of us had lunch reservations on a Sunday afternoon. Even though it was lunch, I would still dress up because almost everyone in there was. For a 3 Michelin starred restaurant, we thought that the lunch was the best deal, as it is $48 for two courses. No other 3 Michelin offers anything like this from what I have seen! We were seated in the main dining room and immediately knew it was going to be an amazing experience. We had an attentive and knowledgeable server who was also pretty weird, but quirky. He was able to make good recommendations as well as great wine pairings.  I ordered the parmesan risotto with mushrooms and the parmesan crusted chicken with artichokes. Yes, I love parmesan. Complimentary appetizer bites were given to the table first. It included an oyster, mushroom soup, and caviar. Each was very impressive and had great flavors unlike what I have had before! They were carefully thought out recipes and a superb way to start the meal. Next up, perfectly cooked risotto and amazing mushrooms. Best risotto I have ever had! Creamy, cheesy, and complimented by the mushrooms. The parmesan crusted chicken came next, and this proved to be even better. I loved the sauce and artichokes paired with the crispy, tender chicken. I did not think the parmesan was too much for both dishes. Needless to say, I cleared both plates easily and I would highly recommend both dishes.  We were contemplating dessert, but I am glad we decided to pass because they gave us a complimentary dessert plate with little chocolates and homemade marshmallows. Topped off the meal perfectly! We left extremely happy and extremely full. I could definitely get used to this kind of service! Such a great value and amazing food. I can only imagine what the dinner tasting menu is like. Jean Georges is out there to impress, and he definitely suceeded. OMG- Ok, by the 7th course I was soooo stuffed but save room for dessert. It was unbelievable. My girlfriends and I had a very memorable girls night on the city. If you are on the fence definitely go!!!! Impeccable...from the service to the food to the decor. We arrived a few minutes early and were seated right away. This was a great indication of a good dining experience. We had 4 courses each...5 if you count the dessert. Each course had beautiful presentation and flavor. Thoroughly enjoyed the fish...so flakey and couldn't have been cooked better. They kept filling us up w/ tidbits and sweets. Each time you go through the door to the restroom and back, someone would open the door for you. Nice. Had tasting menu at Jean-George's a while back and it was wonderful! Impeccable service and food, wines. Went back twice last year and ate outside. Great again! Like this restaurant a lot. Jean-Georges, was just a series of little missteps, which culminated in this review. If you're reading this review, you're probably looking for a magical night out, but in a city chock-full of 3-Michelin Star restaurants, it's hard for me to say, \"Come here first.\" if at all. So here we go, our evening started perfectly, the front desk was attentive, polite, and seated us immediately. The restaurant is kinda small, I understand it's New York, but I like a little bit more intimacy when eating. I always felt like I had servers whizzing pass me (or occasionally bumping my chair). Additionally, it was much too warm. I know, peoples internal thermometers vary, but in a restaurant where you're required to keep a coat on, it was hot. Both of my dates made the same comment and they were in light tops/dresses. Additionally, the curtains were closed. Perhaps it was to avoid seeing any unsavory New York night life, but it felt claustrophobic. I did like the massive chandelier that dominated the ceiling, but there wasn't much else to look at. We opted for 3 tasting menus, and paid the $100 per plate up-charged to the 5 gram (odd that they were charging by the gram) white truffle pasta and a trio of mixed drinks, which were refreshing. The meal started out with the best dish of the night. A caviar dish over warm potatoes.  If every course was as thoughtful as this dish, you'd be reading a five star review (I can overlook a lot of flaws if the food is perfect!). But it became a bit rocky from there. The scallop dish was interesting, warm scallops, cold infused fruit, but then it had this red sauce. I hate to utter these next words, but it was almost like ketchup. Which is to say it would've gone WONDERFUL with fries, I didn't like it with scallops.  Intermission for bread! It was FANTASTIC. They have this Swiss (I think? Or Swedish?) Rye bread that was to die for. It had this hint of black licorice, I loved it. But, it brings us to another small miss for a restaurant of this caliber, no crumb removal. I know, \"Paul, you're being petty.\" Which is probably true, but seriously, it's one of those things we expect. Now the truffle course. First, it was bland city. The server informed us that was to ensure the truffles were the star. Perhaps that's true? But butter noodles? Come on. The other issue (oddity?) was the truffles weren't added table side. This meant my $100 worth of white truffles sat under a heat lamp and came out just a bit soggy. There are better truffle dishes in New York. The meal got a little better, for me, with the Sea Bass, served in an interesting sweet sauce (my dates did not like it), and the venison which was a beautiful medium rare, served with cabbage, it was my second favorite course. The lobster. I'm convinced there's just no good way to serve lobster other than with a huge vat of butter or in a soup. This thing was an herby mess.  Now, the staff clearly knew we didn't love every course (which they seemed shocked by?). They brought us our final dessert course, plus, three of their signature desserts (gratis, 5 stars for that guys, thanks).  Whiiiich brings me to my next complaint (not about the desserts they were an absolute home run.) Portion Size. I expect to leave a tasting full, sometimes painfully full, but I don't expect to have to stop eating whole plates of food around course 3 or 4. The portions here were just out of control big. My dates were \"Forcing Down\" stuff because they hated to see it wasted. With two big pasta courses, and a serious hunk of sea bass, it was just way too much food. Less is more sometimes. Final complaint, crunchy macaroons. Seriously, the place reeks of Frenchness and you bring me crunchy macaroons? Gah! Jean-Georges didn't put their best foot forward tonight. As I started with, if you're looking for that \"Once in a lifetime meal\", then consider all your options very carefully. On two occasions I came to New York for vacation and this was a place that a New Yorker had recommended to me. Since I was on vacation is was easy for me to get a lunch time reservation for a weekday but if you are going to dine here you will need a reservation so make sure you make one in advance! I was interested in their prix fixe menu because for $38 it seemed like you got to try a few great items. I was so impressed by their food both the first and second time I came here. The presentation of the food is part of the experience. The staff explains all the liquids, ingredients and flavors in the food that make the dish. My friend and I talked about the great combination of flavors in each dish. You are hit with flavor after just having tried one flavor but the flavors are so unique that they also compliment each other. The waiters will pour the sauce of flavoring in front of you and will check on you to make sure you are having a great experience. Speaking of which, service is great here. You will feel like royalty eating here. One time I ate here a very nice old man who sat at the table to my right started dozing off after his meal. The waitress kindly offered him a pillow if he wanted to take a siesta. Of course he declined and said he would get back to his room. I thought it was sweet.  The prix fixe menu changes as the seasons change, but everything I've tried has been great. At the end of your meal they will come around with a dessert prix pixe menu that costs additional money, if you decide not to go for it rest assured that they will still give you chocolates, macaroons, and the freshest marshmallows I've ever had (which will they cut for you right in front of you)!  Make sure you dress appropriately here. No tennis shoes are allowed. Everyone here is dressed elegantly and professional so dress accordingly unless you want to stand out, in a bad way. Definitivamente no es un tres estrellas Micheln, y no entiendo porqu las tiene. Aunque la localizacin del restaurante es perfecta, tiene algunos detalles que no me gustaron mucho: el restaurante es muy amplio, pero parece una aerolnea low cost, lleno de mesas demasiado cercanas. Algo curioso es que solo hay un cuarto de bao para hombres habiendo tantas mesas, y eso hace que haya que esperar como en una discoteca. Ahora bien, la comida s estuvo buensima. Pedimos el men degustacin, y salimos bastante satisfechos, tanto por cantidad como por calidad. Pero no es un men sorprendente, ni aprendimos ningn sabor nuevo o textura. Por eso me extraa que tenga tres estrellas. An as, un gran restaurante al que ir. Let me start out by stating that the $128 pre-fixe menu with three dishes plus desserts is TOTALLY WORTH IT. I chose: Sea Urchin, Black Bread, Jalapeno and Yuzu: generous portion of sea urchin served on top of lightly toasted black bread - they went together very well. I first thought a hint of yuzu on top of sea urchin was a bit weird, but the combination definitely grew on me.  Turbot with Chateau Chalon Sauce: this was the first time I've tried turbot and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The fish was only lightly seasoned, but the texture was so soft that I didn't even have to use a knife to cut it. The highlight of the dish was, of course, the chateau chalon sauce! I don't even know what it is made out of, but it was so good that I was practically licking the plate in the end. It went very well with the lightly seasoned fish and made the dish very flavorful yet not overwhelming overall. Duck Breast Topped with Cracked Jordan Almonds: perfectly grilled to medium-rare. The meat went very well with the almond crust on top as well as the sauce on the side. It was possibly one of the best duck dish I've ever had in the city. The portion was quite generous, so I felt very full in the end.  For desserts, you get to pick one from chocolate, strawberry, fig and summer special. I went with strawberry since I was craving something light after my heavy duck dish. The sorbet and sponge cake were excellent, but I kind of wish I had picked the chocolate one; my friends seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their warm chocolate lava cake and white chocolate ice cream.  The pre-fixe is complemented with several small-bite dishes (broccoli soup, three different kinds of sorbet, etc.) here and there and I was satisfied with every one of them. Even the complimentary bread served in the beginning was great. In sum, this was one of the best fancy dining experiences I've had. I was a bit taken back by the fact that the noise level was higher than I expected (certainly not loud, but not quiet and serene either), but I think in retrospect that it made the overall experience less overwhelming and more enjoyable in the end. Needless to say the service and ambiance were amazing through and through. I highly recommend this place for any special occasion; given the quality and portion of food, the pre-fixe is definitely worth every single penny. To be entirely honest, based on my meal alone I would give this 3 Michelin star restaurant 5/5. However there were 3 of us and we all tasted each other's dishes, not every single dish deserved a standing ovation. In addition the service, although very conscientious, timely, and unfailingly polite, was not quite perfect. We all ordered the autumn tasting menu, choosing 2 courses which were capped with various amuse bouche and dessert bites. I usually have a very good memory of exactly what I ordered, however not for this meal because (and here is where the service was a tiny bit lacking) mostly because our server was a bit awkward. He spoke with quite a strong lisp, very quickly, quietly and stumbling over his words often, making it difficult to understand what we were eating in detail.  I thought the hand crafted vessels were a lovely touch. Most of the glasses and plates were unique and slightly \"flawed\" with the feel of dining by the ocean from sea shells.  The amuse were delicious bites. Memory fails, but one was a deep fried but light and crispy ball of an autumn vegetable, another was a very umami crunchy rice square, and a very large sip of a gazpacho like soup.  My yellowfin ribbon appetizer was very delicious and an interesting presentation although if dipped too much into the Avocado wasabi soy sauce it swam in, it was very salty. (granted my palate is salt sensitive). The other appetizers: a sea trout and oyster Tartare with diced bits of egg and Meyer lemon (yum!) was deliciously balanced with a lovely popping texture like caviar, and another sashimi style hamachi dish topped with radish that I found a bit ordinary.  For main dishes, my sweetbreads with chestnuts was not a pretty dish but very delicious. The flavors complemented each other perfectly. The skuna Salmon dish was tasty, the cremini a nice touch but overall unremarkable. The veal scallopine was a big disappointment. It was fried to overdoneness with a large slice of salty ham glued to the top. It had the texture of beef jerky, no tenderness or nuance of flavor. It tasted like an overly fried piece of ham.  We opted not to get dessert as we were doing a whirlwind food tour of NYC and had other places to go (momofuku crack pie siren call) but the meal included various yummy truffle nibbles (peanut butter and jelly, rose, hazelnut, etc flavors) and a fluffy hand made marshmallow that were a perfect dessert.  All in all a wonderful experience with a couple speed bumps, but $48 for prix fixe at this 3 Michelin is an amazing value and overall we were not disappointed. This place is amazing! Certainly some of the finest food I've ever had. We did the prefix menu for dinner and we sure did enjoy it! The service was great and the ambiance was pleasant. What can I say, it's one of the best places you can eat in NYC which is saying a lot! Came here for lunch for a birthday + anniversary combo and I couldn't be happier. For 3 Michelin stars, $48 for 2 plates is a very good deal. Decor was simple and pretty - I loved the flowers placed on our table and the large chandelier in the center of the room. Service was impeccable & food was outstanding. We opted to order a third plate to share for $24 and we could barely finish it. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I'm already thinking about making a reservation to come back again! So it's my brother's birthday again, and he picks his restaurants by Michelin Stars. We've yet to dine at Jean-Georges, so we had a reservations for 8 pm. It was just the two of us. Not a very impressive entrance - small lobby. The door into Jean-Georges first leads you to Trump International's bar area, so that was not expect. The restaurant itself is then to the left. Small place, not very well decorated. Nothing like the presentation of \"Daniel\". We weren't seated in a both, so my chair was a bit smaller than I liked. The first thing I will remember is the staff. Every single server was friendly, courteous, and with a smile. And it didn't matter if the server assigned to our table was around, it seems they worked as a team, so everyone will do their part to make your stay the absolute best. My brother chose the Jean-Georges' Menu, and I chose the Spring Menu. He added the duck as it wasn't on his menu, which was then an overload of excess food. That dish came out as an entree, which by the end of the full menu proved too much. Though he enjoyed it, he didn't finish it. Loved my menu from the get-go. We were treated with a palate-cleansing tea and a small piece of tuna/salmon (weren't paying attention) before the first item. Caviar/egg/yogurt?! Sounds a bit odd, but wow, what a great way to kick things off. Just an explosion of great flavors in your mouth. The morel mushroom and asparagus were just so flavorful. Was not too keen on the lobster. I guess I'm used to a much bigger portion of it, and just having a claw and half of tail was not too satisfying for me. There was a substitute of my menu from veal cheek to lamb chop, which I didn't mind. Again, like to taste the meat, so the nut crumb and mint covering was not my favorite. I like the portion of the piece just as it was cooked. And it was cooked to perfection. I didn't have the wine pairing, but my brother did. I'm not sure if this is the way to go as he did not finish any of the glass he was poured. I just had a glass of champagne since I'm simple that way. I just want to taste the dishes and have a cup of coffee afterwards. There was an array of dessert after the last dish. Didn't understand why another tray of plate cleansing ice cream was served before the dessert. I am thinking it was to bridge the time gap, and not necessary as a planned menu presentation. Really, who would need that much dessert?! I enjoyed the pastry the most. The coffee was outstanding. Have to go on the record to say it is probably the second best coffee I ever had (best was in London). So would be come back again? I would. My brother can't stop raving about the Foie Gras and his frog legs. Not my type of food. I would recommend you really understand the dishes before ordering. These type of dining experiences are strictly for the palate, but I do care about all little details. Like the finger cleaning towel, where the server places a ear plug size towel on a plate, then poured the water to expand it to a regular towel size. Was pleasing for the other senses. With tip (not sure why we didn't have to tip the captain) was just under $1,000. We left just after 11 pm. Again, great wait staff. I can only wish that all restaurants have this level of a wait staff. It was certainly an evening to remember. The lunch deal at Jean-Georges is absolutely worth it - $48 for 2 plates, $24 for each additional plate over your \"2 plate option.\" Although I want to give Jean-Georges a 5-star, I've decided to rate it a 4.5 star because the main entree was a bit slightly underwhelming for my boyfriend and i. Food: Between my boyfriend and I, we ordered 5 plates (1 additional). Our meal starts off with a 'free' mise en bouche.  Mise en Bouche Oyster (4.5) - lots of acidity but it was deliciousness! Mise en bouche Mushroom Ravioli (4) - great flavors but it was a tad too salty and I would've loved a small spoon so I didn't have to drink it from the tiny bowl Mise en bouche Yellowtail (5) - AMAZING. a finely cut piece of top with a fried tapioca underneath it. There were so many flavors in it and a great start to the meal. Hamachi Sashimi (5) - Really big pieces of hamachi with great acidity to it from the sherry vinaigrette Diver Scallops (4) - 3 decently sized scallops. my boyfriend loved it but i found the caper-raisin emulsion to be incredibly salty. So if you do choose to order this, just don't scoop up too many of the emulsion on the plate onto your scallops. Otherwise, the scallops + the cauliflower on top of it together alone it delicious. Parmesan Risotto (5) - not a fan of risottos usually, but Jean-Georges made it so tasty with a subtle flavor of parmesan that it hit my palette perfectly. Arctic Char (3) - This was more of the 'main entree' of my meal and after all these amazing dishes, the arctic char was a slight disappoint. It pretty much tastes like Salmon and although it was supposed to be good 'medium rare,' it was more like medium to medium-well done. My arctic char was slightly overcooked and sauce on the side was almost just a straight up chunk of honey that didn't complement too well with the char. Veal Scallopine (3.5) - my boyfriend and I thought the veal was flavored well but also a tad overcooked. It wasn't the easiest to chew even though the flavors were there. Overall, our experience at Jean-Georges was extremely positive (despite our waitress never once smiling at us except for the last 10 minutes of our experience. we were scared of her the whole time), although next time I come back, i'll be sure to pick a different entree. Possibly the best food I've ever had in an beautiful room that exudes elegance. Jean Georges creativity is matchless & the service is impeccable. Hint: The lunch menu is a steal. Just book well ahead if you want to get a seat. Best Restaurant of New York City. This is 3 stars restaurant for Michelin Guide 2015. According to Michelin 2015, 3 stars just 6 restaurants in the NYC. Perfect service and food. Great experience and good location right by Central Park and columbus circle. Don't arrive too early though because we had to wait a little to be seated until it was our reservation time. Had the tasting menu and my favorite was the caviar with tapioca dish. There were also complimentary macarons chocolate and housemade marshmallows at the end of the meal. I went to this place as my second 3 Michelin star in a weekend so my expectations were already pretty high. On the bright side the food was great (as it should) and beautiful presentation. The service was polite and professional but just what you can expect from this kind of places, so if there's such a thing, I would say the service was \"average 3 Michelin star\". I know this is not the restaurant's problem but the crowd was a little snobbish imho. I guess the location and the fact that you must wear a jacket makes people more arrogant.  The price wasn't as bad as other places so that's certainly a plus :) In the sad side I got sick, like really sick. I think it was some fish related food poisoning which I don't blame them from that, it can happen anywhere. I called them the next day to let them know but again, seafood is like that, I guess. Cheers Came here for lunch with the wife. We had great unforgettable experience. Food was fantastic. We opted for their 48.00 specials. Loved the tuna ribbon, veal was ok. would get it again, stick to seafood! Wife had black sea bass, love it also! We got chocolate desert, one word - amazeballs! Place had a nice tune to it, service was attentive. Servers were synchronized. There is a reason they are a 3 machelin guide rated. I mean, what can I really say that hasn't been said about this place. The food was just perfect - totally awesome. The sommelier picked the perfect wine to pair with our food, and the service was perfect. That's the word - perfect - that really describes this place. I had the foie gras brulee, duck, and gulf shrimp with smoked bacon. They were all fantastic - the foie gras was really special.  Inside is perfect - all neutral tones, really relaxing, and you can see the trees outside and central park which makes it feel like you're in a garden, not in NYC, pretty fantastic. You better not eat anything before you come here! I came in on an empty stomach and left just completely and totally stuffed. I have no idea how. Save room for the marshmellows and candies at the end. Outstanding restaurant. I would've given it a 5 stars, but I did notice inconsistencies in the service, even though they did a great great great job. however, I tend to be tougher for 3 michelin rated restaurants. The food was awesome and beautifully presented. I do think that certain dishes lacked creativity, but tastes made up for it. My husband and I went for our anniversary, and were impressed to the attention of detail by the servers, sommelier, and chefs. Wow! No wonder they got a 3-star Michelin rating. It's an experience, be prepared for a 3-hour dinner service. We would recommend the wine pairing, that was fun. Not to be pretentious... But I've eaten at Joel Robuchon, Le Bernadin, WD50 on down the list... I love love love good - no extraordinary - food. However, in all this good restaurant goodness, I was not prepared for the amazing culinary experience that was Jean Georges.  First our service was second to none. Super high end restaurant so it goes with the territory... But living in LA where we can go to a high end restaurant (ala Capo in Santa Monica for example) and spend $500 on dinner for two and have shitty service by an out of work actor, I truly appreciate the professional wait staff experience... They were like stealth ninjas who would appear with treats and vanish with a plate. I love that!!! But the food.... Saddle up kids.... Oh my god I still think about it a month later. From the unexpected granola, strawberry foie gras to the fish and whatever that magic broth had in it... Sweet Jesus I was in heaven. I put some of the sweet and sour broth on my fianc's suckling pork which made it even juicier as if that were possible. Pretzel bread, little intermezzo sorbet and a few bottles of good Bordeaux later and I left the most memorable meal of my life. No question I will look forward to round two with Mr. Vongerichten!! 4.5 Exceptional service and delicious food. Both the dinner and tasting lunches were memorable. The decor is quite exquisite and you FEEL like you're having a special meal. This helps set the tone of the experience. On top, the plating dishes and stoneware are also unique and enhance the dishes. It's really a treat for the senses. The food themselves are well-executed and delicious. Nothing was particularly extra-imaginative, but it doesn't always have to be. Sometimes a perfect meal is what fits the bill. Found the tasting menu at dinner to be a great value compared to a lot of other 3-star Michelin menus in the city. The dining room is beautiful: big, light/airy, modern but sophisticated.  I still think about the creative dessert we had 3 years ago: it was like some funky \"bento box\" of desserts. This review is long overdue as my last meal there was 2 years ago. Yes it's late...I had another bebe and moved the entire family to Hawaii so I've been ocupado;) This was my 2nd time at JG and after my last experience years ago, I had often dreamt of returning. I had distinctly remembered the impeccable and personable service (in fact, my 1st time was 3 months after 9/11 and the maitre' d gave me a CD of songs he had chosen that he felt addressed the emotions of the events - random memory but it was unusual enough to remember after all these years). So this time at Jean Georges- My husband & I wanted to do something special for friends of ours who had taken us out to a great high-end Portuguese restaurant where we were completely spoiled. The wife loves French and had never been here so, I thought this was a brilliant idea. Now our friends are \"high rollers\" and we knew we'd be going over our usual dining budget on this excursion but thought, 'What the heck, they've been good to us, and we're about to have a baby & then move 5,000 miles away so...why not? I was 9 months pregnant and HUGE but fairly certain I'd be given some mercy making me way through the crowd (It's NYC but still...). We gave the car to the valet (more on that later) and since we'd arrived early, sat at the bar for drinks. A housemade passionfruit soda for me, some kind of mixed drink for another, scotch for the 3rd and beer for the other half. Everyone was happy with their drinks but still trying to see if the prego angle scores us a few seats. A few futile minutes later we're offered 2 seats by a gentleman. It's...............wait for it............ ................ STING AND TRUDIE STYLER!!!! Ok, now this night is getting interesting and I try to convince my husband who's wondering how much this night is going to set us back, that it's now all worth it because we met STING!!! Ok, well we exchanged a few words, they congratulated me, she touched the belly and they went back to eating at the bar and flirting like young new lovers (a page from that book can be taken by all of us actually...who acts like that after so many years?!!!). Ok, back to the dinner- We were seated shortly thereafter and decide to go with the tasting menu- I don't eat red meat or foie gras so I did ask for a modification to their planned courses. Ok, I'd be lying if I said that I remember most of the courses (besides, I was too blown away by having met Sting). One thing I do recall is that I spoke with the server about the caviar egg that I fondly remembered having all those years ago. She informed me that they were still available and that it would be a \"travesty\" if I didn't get one for all four in the party...well, who was I to argue since she was so passionate about it. And rightfully so, it was exquisite with its cracked egg and delicious foam topped by a bit of osetra. We all were delighted with each course and the ambiance being both elegant and laid back (not entirely common in French restaurants). Our service was impeccable with the staff not missing a beat the entire night. My husband was so impressed that he almost didn't mind the exorbitant bill (almost being the operative word). As he started to make peace with the fact that we'd spent $140 on 4 eggs alone, we made our way through the restaurant thanking those who had mercy on my huge (and now full) belly and let us through. My husband felt generous and gave the valet $20 thinking \"Why not, I just spent over $900 inside?\" He was politely informed that the valet charge was $50 before tip. Somehow even meeting Gordon & Trudie didn't take away that sting (sorry, couldn't resist ;) Just went to JG on a Saturday night, would definitely go again. We spent a good time deciding between either the 3 dish Prix Fixe, traditional tasting course or the Autumn course. We decided to get 6 dishes and share. We decided to get the sea urchin, bay scallops, caramelized foie gras, hake, maine lobster and wagyu beef. All exceptional and perfectly cooked. They also included a three sampling appetizer of a komoto oyster, mushroom ravioli and tuna tartar... yum! We barely finished out dessert (Autumn and chocolate sampling) but it was all worth it. We shared three cocktails (raspberry lychee, ginger margerita and passion fruit whiskey sour)... the passion fruit was definitely the strongest. Overall, highly recommended. Food was great and the service was excellent. Came here a second time for lunch and was slightly less impressed than my first visit - which has to do with the fact that I came with a larger group and was able to try more dishes.  The $48 lunch deal remains a good one although it seemed just 2 months ago, they were offering a $38 deal? Anyway, service is good. We started off with 3 amuse bouches (corn fritter, raspberry gazpacho and a marinated watermelon). The fritter delicious, gazpacho had a bright complicated summery flavor but the watermelon was just weird For appetizers, I got to try the Corn Ravioli, Gazpacho, Scallops and Tuna Ribbons. The Tuna Ribbons and Corn Ravioli was hands down my favorites! The basil sauce combined with the heirloom tomatoes on the ravioli made it such an amazing dish and the Ribbons (a signature) was one of the best raw tuna dishes I have ever had. The scallop was also very good but the Gazpacho was once again a dud though it tasted very different from the one provided as an amuse For mains, I had the Salmon with miso yuzu sauce which was very good and also got to try the Black Bass, Beef Tenderloin and Chicken. The Bass was bursting was flavor and still my favorite entree for lunch at JG but the Beef which required a surcharge was nothing special and the same can be said for the chicken. I would DEF stick with the seafood at JG.  Will I be back? Certainly but I'm writing this review to make sure I order the hits and not the misses. A decent place to celebrate an anniversary with good atmosphere and quality food. However, food was a bit salty, so if s/one doesn't like saltness, let them know that before making order. Wow, this was an amazing food experience. Every bite was delicious... many were super inventive that I don't even know what I had.... and all were beautifully plated. Our waiter was so well dressed I don't even know what to say about that. =) He was very knowledgeable about the food, too.  And for the amount of food we got, I might even say it was on the cheap side for price.  I can't even recall everything that I had ... looking at the menu now... Santa Barbara uni - very tasty and fresh.  Crispy confit of suckling pig -- you had me at crispy and confit I'm an eater and will eat beyond comfort. But towards the end I was just nibbling. And by the time the marshmallows and the beautiful dessert came out, I was dying. But leave no stone unturned! I had at least two bites of everything.  OMG, and the sorbet ........ soooo refreshing and perfect.  Sorry, I know this is all over the place, but I went two months ago and slowly it's coming back to me.  I wish I lived closer. I'd be there quite often. STORY:  Oh, Jean-Georges! What can I add to your already 1000 reviews that has not been said? Well, I shall add my two cents anyway -- here goes! (Review for lunch.)  I came to JG last April, but dragged my feet on writing a review. I think the problem is that in my heart I knew it was three stars, and that seemed wrong. Eventually enough time passed that I kindof forgot.  [I do remember having the peekytoe crab dumplings, foie gras brule, and citrus dessert. I can't remember our entrees but I didn't like anything listed here.]  But, since Sunday (1/26) was my birthday, and I'd taken off work on Monday (thank God! that brunch!) I decided to treat myself to one last birthday celebration of a leisurely lunch. And the great thing about a weekday lunch is that you can call an hour in advance and usually get a reservation. But no jeans or t-shirts in the dining room!  My friend and I both ordered the Taste of Winter -- a two course lunch for $48. Of course, those two courses come with a multi-bite amuse bouche and a small dessert plate, on top of the appetizer and entree you order. So it will be enough food! Add that $9 glass of the Montepulciano and you've got yourself a meal, woman!   __________________ SCENE:  Really funny mix of people. Lots of Asian tourists (pictures!!!!), older couples, business lunches, and people who probably eat here regularly.  Very quiet, very bright, very open. Decent space between tables, depending on where you are.  Great view of Columbus Circle from street level, which is unusual in this city of rooftops but still very picturesque and serene.  __________________ FOOD:  To start, we had the sea urchin and the sesame crab toast. I didn't touch the urchin, but my friend said it was delish. She liked that it was served on toast to give you multiple flavors and textures at once. The crab toast absolutely melted in my mouth. Highly recommend. Our amuse bouche (pictured) was a parsnip soup, a mini eggroll with I think salmon inside, and a baby beet with elderflower and wasabi garnish. The parsnip soup was fantastic. It was hot, it was simple, it was flavorful, and I wished it wouldn't end. Every time I saw another table get the plate, I was jealous!  Entrees were the hake and the sweetbreads. When I asked our server (an adorable blond who was lovely and sweet) what sweetbreads were, she politely replied, \"they are... an internal organ from venison.\" Hahaha! My friend said she liked them... I tried a very small bite but can't comment on how good they were. I do remember that the ginger flavor is more powerful than the licorice flavor.  My hake was superb. It was cooked perfectly, and the tender celeriac underneath really was young and tender!! I didn't even use my knife -- everything fell apart at the touch of my fork. For dessert, we opted to split the \"Winter\" dessert tasting. Friend was hesitant as she didn't think she'd like the flavors, but I convinced her on the grounds that you should always order seasonal items!  Squash we had first, and it was sweet and didn't taste like a vegetable. Crepe thing came next, and that was super forgettable and bland. The piece de resistance, though, was the pear -- poached, filled with a dollop of mascarpone, rolled in rose petals and pistachios, and bathed (at the table) in caramel. Did you hear me? ROLLED IN ROSE PETALS AND BATHED IN CARAMEL. I think I know how I need to start spending my Saturday nights, guys. If I didn't think the businessman at the next table was cute, I would have licked my plate. Oh my goodness. And of course, while we're in the middle of dessert, we get a little plate of petit fours, a bowl of two mini macaroons, and the house-made clouds... er, I mean vanilla bean marshmallows.  Swoon. The best part about lunch for two is that including a shared dessert and one glass of wine, our bill was $105 (including tax but before tip). You can easily not get the dessert or drinks to keep the price closer to $100 (with tax and tip), or enjoy the sweet deal you're getting and get your own dessert. :)  I will definitely be back! ***Jean-Georges did not measure up to other highly restaurants I've been to across the country; the food was not as creative or contemporary as some of the more push-the-envelope restaurants like wd~50 and Saison, which I would not expect given its style of cuisine; unfortunately, the skill in the kitchen, the presentations and the resulting flavors were a noticeable step below those restaurants too*** Jean-Georges is one of the most highly rated fine dining restaurants in the entire country. It is also one of the most accessible too with a reasonably priced lunch menu. For dinner, Jean-Georges features an option where you design your own menu, a tasting menu of their classic dishes and a seasonal tasting menu. Neither tasting menu excited me so I opted to design my own menu. That might have been a mistake. With Jean-Georges, I felt the food was decent but definitely not up to its reputation or high prices (maybe their tasting menu would have been more exciting). My first course was seared scallops with caramelized cauliflower and caper raisin emulsion. The scallops were great--perfect sear that was slightly crispy but not salty (also very soft and moist). I liked the cauliflower too--tender but also a nice crispy side to provide a different texture. The caper raisin sauce was really sloppily applied. My next course was also an ugly presentation (too brown and grey). It was seared foie gras over toasted brioche with a lychee sauce and black olive. The lychee was great and went well with the foie gras. I did not like the overly dry sear on the foie gras, but the foie gras itself had a good flavor and was very creamy. LA's Providence once did a similar foie gras preparation, but you will see a big difference (Providence's dish was much more vibrant). Jean-Georges' foie gras: Providence's foie gras: Next came a lobster course with lime and corn. Like the preceding courses, the protein was cooked nicely with the lobster soft and moist (though not as moist as lobster I've had at Providence, The French Laundry or Baume). The corn was fine but kind of ordinary. My final savory course was lamb chops with a tomato chutney and haricot verts. Similar to the other courses, I felt the presentation was quite poor. The lamb was okay. It was moist and had a decent flavor. I wish there was a better char. The tomato chutney was not that good--a little bit sweet and a little bit of heat but not that memorable. The summer haricot verts was a really basic side. Dessert is kind of fun where they take one primary ingredient (like chocolate) and create four mini desserts out of that ingredient. They offer more than one option so I ended up trying two--their signature chocolate tasting menu and a stone fruit option. The stone fruit tasting menu was just okay. In terms of the chocolate dessert, some of the mini desserts were also just okay like the chocolate tart with sorbet and the white chocolate ice cream. The chocolate with kumquats was simple yet satisfying, but I really enjoyed the warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. You can find many good versions of this dessert across the country. Still, this one stood out. The chocolate cake had a crispy exterior that was not dry while the molten chocolate center was perfect--not too gooey, liquidy or underdone. It was simply perfect with a luscious richness. The warm cake went very well with the cool and creamy vanilla ice cream. Dinner ended with a series of mignardises including marshmallows that they snip at the table with scissors. As mentioned, prices are high for dinner though their dinner prices are actually a notch below several similarly highly rated restaurants in the Bay Area. The atmosphere is very nice. The room is elegant, but it is a modern room and it does not feel stuffy at all. There are also great big windows that allow you to look onto Central Park. Service was very good--very polished and professional but personable. I really liked the young woman who assisted my server--probably the most polite server I've had at any restaurant in the U.S. While Jean-Georges served food that tasted fine, I was disappointed with their flavors, presentations and quality. In many ways, Jean-Georges reminded me of Las Vegas restaurants where the restaurant comes from a big name, but what is put on the plate does not feel particularly personal or done with much care. Because of this, Jean-Georges simply does not provide the one-of-a-kind experience that you get with its peers (The French Laundry, Saison). I am not sure what the parking situation is. Underwhelmed.  As a rare three michelin star restaurant, I expected to be as wowed as I was at Eleven Madison or Le Bernardin. I was not. The food, I review below, dish by dish. It was of course, very good food. but it wasn't mind blowing. There were some parts that were excellent, others that I didn't love, but most of it just simply wasn't memorable. at all.  I went with one of my closest friends, his wife, and my boyfriend. We had a great time, because we were in great company, but the overall feeling of the place was very out dated, and not in a quaint way.  The service was lackluster even though the servers were all very professional...I'm not sure how that can be, except that I guess there just wasn't any joy in it. The young woman that served us seemed very new, didn't really seem to be excited about the menu and didn't seem to have many recommendations or opinions. It just didn't have the grace I was looking for and didn't live up to the hype.  On to the food. I had the: SPRING MENU the first course was the: MEYER LEMON GELE with Caviar and Crme Frache-- this dish as the opener was interesting. I didn't hate it, but the lemon gelee got to be a little too much. I actually loved the bite of the egg caviar that my boyfriend had in his tasting menu much more. the second course was the: MADAI SASHIMI Muscat Grapes, Buttermilk Emulsion and Herbs- this dish was forgettable. The fish was fresh, but the grapes didn't pair that perfectly with it. It was ok. the third course was the: GREEN ASPARAGUS Wild Oregon Morels, Asparagus Jus-- I actually really loved this dish. It was an interesting blend of fresh but earthy and rich flavor. the fourth course was the: SAUTEED BLACK SEA BASS Lily Bulb-Radish Salad with Sesame Vinaigrette-- very asian inspired. I loved the radish. the fifth course was the: BUTTER POACHED LOBSTER Saffron Tapioca, Gewurtztraminer and Passion Fruit-- This was my favorite part of the meal. I loved this dish. the lobster was buttery and the passion fruit added just the perfect zest to the dish to give it that edge. the sixth course was the: RACK OF COLORADO LAMB Smoked Chili Glaze, Spring Onion and Tatsoi-- the lamb was perfectly done. I liked it a lot. but it wasn't very memorable. the dessert was the: RHUBARB DESSERT TASTING My boyfriend had the: JEAN-GEORGES' MENU EGG CAVIAR DIVER SCALLOPS Caramelized Cauliflower and Caper-Raisin Emulsion YOUNG GARLIC SOUP with Thyme and Sauted Frog Legs TURBOT with Chteau Chalon Sauce LOBSTER TARTINE Lemongrass and Fenugreek Broth, Celery BROILED SQUAB Onion Compote, Corn Pancake with Foie Gras Chocolate Dessert Tasting I think the better menu was definitely the Jean-Georges' menu. The lobster though, was killer. I think out of the whole seasonal menu, that was the only dish that I loved more than whatever he was having. Even his dessert was better. The chocolate dessert tasting plate was AMAZING. the rhubarb plate was a little less so. I can't eat chocolate, but I risked hives because it was just that good. I couldn't stop trying to eat all of his mousse.  Now I have to say something about the on the house sweets...So such great desserts...and then...the tacky, way 1999 marshmallows? I could have totally done without. They were fine, but what? They made such a big show about cutting the pieces and they were just...fine. I kind of felt like that really sums up the experience though.  All in all, the meal tasted nice, the service could have been a hiccup due to our server being new, and we had a good time. But at that price point, I wanted to be thinking, \"omfgerd...this is the best...wow...that I've ever...jeez louise...\" but what I got was, \"this is nice!\" I wanted to LOVE this classic restaurant, but I can't say that I do. I like it. I don't LOVE it. oh, and as a PS. We were seated next to another table of four. These four happened to be two white middle aged business men...and their eastern european escorts. WE thought it was funny because we're in our early 30's and just basically laughed covertly to each other about the squealing and the lap sitting and the not so covert gropage and dirty talk, but others may not enjoy it as much as we did while having say...their parent's anniversary dinner. ^_^ I believe that JG was my first actual fine dining experience in NYC. At that time I didn't have too many expectations from any of the quality restaurants. To be honest, I didn't have any idea about what it means to be a Michelin 3 Star restaurant. Well time has passed and I can now say I'm a little more experienced with fine dining establishments in NYC and other cities in the world. I have to say there is something special about JG. There is something that keeps me coming back. I'm still trying to understand what it is. I hope to have it figured out by the end of my review. Ambiance: The ambiance is always consistent at JG. This is what I mean. When you enter the building you can either go to the right or to the left. If you go to the right you go to their bar area which is called Nugatine. However, it's not just a bar. It also has a little dining area which, one could say, is a casual version of JG. The bar area is always busy and crowded. The patrons there are mostly finance guys. I have to ask this next question. Are there any other guys that go to NYC bars besides \"finance guys\"? Hey, all you \"non-finance guys\" stop into some of these classy bars, ok? :)  Alright, back to the review. You will see people dining at the bar which gives the place life and enhances the ambiance.  To the left is the main dining area of JG. It is a little bit more calm and less fast paced which, I think, is what you would expect. The patrons there are mostly classy representatives of the UWS. Being more politically correct they seem more of the \"hoi polloi\" of the Upper West Side. But on another note, I didn't see any \"finance guys\". :)  You will see some tourists there too, perhaps because of the location. They are usually wearing jeans and \"tee shirts\", that's how I recognize them. I may be a bit old fashioned but I still like to see people dress more appropriately when dining at a place like JG. It's always better to be overdressed rather then underdressed. Why not, it's just better. Food: On this recent visit to JG my dinner associate and I tried something new. We both ordered from the tasting menu.  The tasting menu has two options; the JG menu or the seasonal menu. In this case the seasonal menu was the winter menu. The tasting menu is a little bit more pricey than the pre-fixe menu. We had the pre-fixe menu before so we decided to go in a different direction. What a great direction it was! We both personally loved it! One thing I noticed and I really give JG an Anyasez star for this. There aren't any supplementary fees in the tasting menu. You pay a little bit more for this menu but everything is included. You may not think this is a big deal but I do. I find it kind of \"chincy\" when you go to a classy restaurant, order from the tasting menu, and have to \"pay extra\" for truffles or caviar or other items that are not on the \"standard\" menu. It's like an upcharge you get when eating at a diner and you try to substitute the vegetable of the day for the French fries when ordering the cheeseburger special.   Whatever the case when it comes to the food both menus are great. You definitely won't be disappointed when ordering off of either menu. I still can't forget the egg caviar dish I had...mmm so good! I could have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner and you know what...for dessert!  Service: The staff at JG is very accommodating and very professional. It's great when the people that work there give you the feeling that they want to make your experience a memorable one. They will do everything possible to give you an exceptional dining experience. I have no complaints about their service, on any level. I just want to add that I think they are a bit too professional and almost robotic at times. We were trying to loosen them up a bit. We tried...it didn't work :)  This is not a bad thing, just an observation.  Conclusion  Well it's finally time to answer the question of why I keep coming back to JG. No, it's not because there aren't any finance guys dining there. ;) The easiest way to answer the question is this. Read all of the above and add this personal comment. I just feel very comfortable going to JG. I think it's the combination of its great ambiance, its great service and its great menu. Been to Jean-Georges and Nougatine, loved both. The most reasonably priced 3 michelin star restaurant in New York. Classy and spacious, amazing food. Recommend the prefixed lunch for the best bang for your buck. Top notch dining experience.food was an art without doubt..professional service, alluring atmosphere. Will certainly go back.. OMG so yummlicious!!! I was lucky enough to dine here and it was phenomenal. I had the signature Jean-George's fix menu. I'm a seafood lover so that menu is perfect for me. The sea scallops turbot and lobster was mind blowing! I sadly didn't have room for the chocolate Deseret tasting dish. :( Wish I had a bigger stomach!  On to the decor... And it's beautiful but a little stuffy because tons of business client dinners are held there so not a hip place.  Anyhow, one of my favorite restaurants in nyc! Located inside the Trump Tower, Jean-Georges has 3 Michelin stars and is currently ranked #98 in the world. Service is fantastic and the food is very deserving of its ranking. I would actually rank Jean-Georges even higher than some of the top restaurants in the world that I have already eaten at. We got the tasting menu and their first item was one of the dishes that they had served the Michelin crew. This dish was caviar, tapioca and potatoes. The combination of the three was mind blowing and one of the best dishes that I had ever eaten in my life. Service was impeccable and I couldn't have asked for a better meal. Jean-Georges is a rare 4 Michelin starred restaurant, and for good reason.  With my boyfriend slated to leave for India (!) for 3 months, our 5 year anniversary coming up, and my month to \"treat ourselves\", I decided to splurge on Jean-Georges. We had previously dined at other J-G restaurants and enjoyed ourselves, so I knew coming here would be a great idea as well.  Although our reservation was for a later time (8:45pm), they had no trouble seating us in this cute little nook of the restaurant. We had a drink at the bar area, and they brought it over for us as well. The inside of the restaurant is very quaint, but to be honest, I couldn't see much of it, as we were sitting in a little nook. My boyfriend opted for the Summer Tasting Menu, and I chose the Jean-Georges' Menu. The service was impeccable and functioning like a well-oiled machine. Our main server did seem a little awkward at times (she reminded me of Officer Fischer from OITNB haha), but she was very sweet.  We started out with an amuse bouche which included a cucumber yogurt drink and a piece of salmon sashimi, which was absolutely delicious. While we were eating, my boyfriend and I sampled each other's dishes and talked about which one we liked more haha. For the most part, we felt like my dishes were a lot more \"tangy\" and flavorful, while his dishes tasted fresh. Some of the highlights were: the ravioli from the Summer menu (probably one of our favorite dishes of the night), turbot from the Jean-Georges menu, halibut from the Summer menu, the lobster dishes from both, and the lamb chop from the Summer menu.  For dessert, I enjoyed my chocolate tasting more than my boyfriend liked his strawberry tasting. Dessert also came with complimentary petit fours, and they even gave us a chocolate mousse cake and some type of pudding (I don't remember what it was, as I was too busy enjoying it hah), for us to celebrate. We were so full at the end that we couldn't even finish the chocolate mousse cake.  Overall, a very good experience and dinner. The prix fixe menu also looked delicious. Hopefully I can come back again to try it! With 900+ reviews for this world renown 3 Michelin star restaurant, my normal overly verbose review would get lost in the vast ocean of subjective Yelp criticism. So I'm going to take a different approach and use a minimalist approach to summarize my one dining experience here. Having already achieved the pinnacle of haute cuisine praise by being 1 of 7 NYC restaurants to earn the coveted 3 Michelin star rating, Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's flagship restaurant wouldn't be affected in least by an average 1 Yelp star rating. With that said, our party of 6 had a very memorable family dinner here and one that we'll reminisce about for years to come. And now, here's one fool's opinion using as few words as possible: Expensive Luxurious Opulent Mildly pretentious, but not stuffy 1 Central Park West Trump Tower Jacket required Mother of Pearl salt spoon Amuse Bouche - Salmon, pureed potato, savory delicious something on rye. Perfection. Artisan bread Impeccable, well-orchestrated service Sea Urchin Sesame Crusted Foie Gras White Truffle supplement (+$75) Roasted Sweetbreads Black Truffle Vinaigrette Fig themed dessert tray, artistically crafted by a master pastry chef JG monogrammed doggie bag of chocolates for the ladies Exorbitant 4-figure bill, but the memories of the flavors and overall experience will last a lifetime. About a 2-2.5: My husband and I came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I was actually surprised at how easy it was to score a reservation! Jean-Georges is a restaurant by Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten and is located at the Trump Hotel off of Columbus Circle. We were seated in a little hideaway, which was more intimate than being seated in the main area.  The ambiance was okay, but the dining room was bustling and kind of loud, as it was completely jam-packed! The scenic view was not that great, as the windows only had trees covering it, and we couldn't really see out to the main dining area as we were in a private booth (I really think that the restaurant being on the main floor of the Trump Hotel is a disservice and should be on a higher floor, as it would have grand views over Central Park/Columbus Circle). Our main server was Chris, who was professional and friendly. I've noticed that the waitstaff were quite hesitant in placing each of the plates, and seemed a little unsure whether to tell us what the course was, or whether to wait for Chris to come back and explain the ingredients - the execution and the systematic way that is usually observed and experienced was nonexistent and completely out of sync. In addition, I've noticed that the tables were never wiped clean with the brush after each course, which seemed a little off as breads were being served. The menu offers prix-fixe as well as a tasting (Jean-Georges' Menu and the Spring Menu (changes seasonally). I had the assortment of the Chef's signature dishes, which included: Egg Caviar (comes in a clipped egg shell with scrambled egg and salty caviar - this was nice and delicious); Diver Scallops, Caramelized Cauliflower and Caper-Raisin Emulsion (the scallops were overcooked and it was still grainy; I wasn't a fan of the sauce as I thought it wasn't complementary to the scallops); Young Garlic Soup with Thyme and Sauteed Frog Legs (I enjoyed the frog legs as they were salty and crispy; the soup was okay; they also give you a lemon-infused towel to wipe your hand afterwards from gnawing on the frog legs); Turbot with Chateau Chalon Sauce (the turbot was cooked well, but the sauce was a little too heavy for my taste); Lobster Tartine, Lemongrass and Fenugreek Broth, Pea Shoots (the lobster was a little rubbery as it was overcooked; the broth was light); Broiled Squab, Onion Compote, Corn Pancake with Foie Gras (the squab was done medium rare, so it was quite bloddy; I wasn't a fan of the corn pancake as it did not complement the overall dish, even though it was eaten with the foie gras); and, Chocolate Dessert Tasting (housemade chocolates that were more dark chocolate based). My husband had the Spring Menu, which included: Meyer Lemon Gelee with Caviar and Creme Fraiche (this was more on the bitter side, as there seemed to be too much lemon rind); Madai Sashimi, Muscat Grapes, Buttermilk Emulsion and Herbs (extremely bland); Green Asparagus, Wild Oregon Morels, Asparagus Jus (this was actually tasty, which tasted more like cream of mushroom; I enjoyed the morels); Sauteed Black Sea Bass, Lily Bulb-Radish Salad with Sesame Vinaigrette (I wasn't a fan of this as this was also bland); Rack of Colorado Lamb, Smoked Chili Glaze, Spring Onion and Tatsoi (the lamb was also cooked medium rare, so it was quite bloody; the chili glaze had a kick, but was unflavorful); Rhubarb Dessert Tasting (I liked the rhubarb crumble in the glass egg cup the best). In addition, we also received a raspberry dark chocolate mini cake for our anniversary, which was very generous and so cute! I think I was a little underwhelmed with the dining experience, as the food was not as tasty as I thought it would be - all the dishes seemed to be underseasoned. I couldn't refrain from giggling a few times as it was just so odd when we were presented with the plates, and the servers stood there for a few seconds, staring at each other being confused, and then walking away without saying a word! I really liked the desserts, though, and the pretzel bread and the rye breads were very nice; the butter log at first was warm, but the refill was cold and hard to spread. I was also given a mini Jean-Georges gift bag containing two of their housemade chocolates (which were part of the desserts), which I thought was a nice detail. I am glad that I was finally about to try this restaurant out, but not sure if I'd go back! +service was a miss! Pricy and totally worth it! :) I loved the yellowfin tuna ribbons, the caramelized foie gras, and the roasted Maine lobster. The foie gras was soft, fatty, and full of flavor, my favorite dish of the night. The citrus and winter dessert flavors were a perfect end to meal. Best restaurant in NYC. I've been to pretty much every 3-Michelin-Star restaurant in NYC, and Jean Georges is by far the best in terms of variety of dishes, flavors, and textures in the tasting menus, consistency, and price (why pay twice for a tasting menu at Per Se??). The food was delicious, although there were no stand out dishes. Service, obviously fantastic. What else would you expect from a restaurant of this caliber? I just wish there was more creativity to some of the dishes. This one is SOLID. We had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and we were just blown away by the inventive dishes, the exquisite presentation, and the incredibly attentive service. Nothing but praise for this place.  That said though, some entrees are better than others. From their spring menu, I'd avoid the parmesan crusted chicken and the sauted veal scallopine. The clear winners: (1) the black bass crusted with nuts and seeds, served in a sublime sweet and sour broth, which has to be the best fish I've had in NYC; and (2) the crispy confit of suckling pig. My vegetarian friend had a custom-made tofu dish that she raved about for weeks. All in all, worth the price and worth the wait. One of the best meals I've ever had. It's not all hype. The food is incredible!  We went for Sunday lunch (reserved on Open Table which was so easy). I got the yellowfin tuna ribbons to start, with avocado and spicy radish and ginger marinade. It was so flavorful and fresh - my mouth is watering just thinking about it. My husband got the foie gras and strawberry granola - beautiful and crunchy (but sorry, the tuna ribbons were better!)  Second course, we shared the roasted sweetbreads with fragrant picked peach, wild arugula and pink peppercorn. This was the best sweetbreads dish in the history of the universe. The sweet peaches with the sweetbreads (which were almost in a light tempura batter) were an awesome pairing.  Third course, I had the crispy confit of suckling pig with baby beets and ginger vinaigrette. It was this perfect rectangle of the most rich, succulent deliciousness. He had the caramelized beef tenderloin, with wild greens raviolo (basically ravioli), green peppercorn and mustard, which was tasty.  Dessert was a complimentary homemade marshmallow, rose macarons (best ones ever. So soft and subtle and not too sweet) and something else - can't remember! But all three were decadent. We also ordered the chocolate tasting - white chocolate ice cream with yuzu sorbet, milk chocolate custard with candied orange and warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream. After dessert paired with cappuccino which was so hot and so beautifully done, we were on cloud nine.  Service was respectful and attentive. Their wine was awesome (we did the taste pours instead of the full glass, which gave a chance to try different wines without getting too wasted!) All in all, a beautiful meal and would love to go back. So special and memorable. Everything its cracked up to be. From the moment the servers present your courses like synchronized dancers, you know you are in for an experience. The somm, Eric, is approachable as he is knowledgeable. He won't push an overpriced wine unless that is what you are looking for. The food is beyond. The fish is light and flakey, The Kale salad would turn anyone to the supposedly 'passe' green. Every course, the servers, the hostess.... all earning the 3 stars. Eat in the bar or the main dining room and you are in for a treat - but dress well and be ready for the 'scene.' This restaurant is the flagship Restaurant of Jean Georges for nearly 20 years.  I went there a few times when they first opened I visited the restaurant recently and was really impressed with food and service. We had the price fixed menu and it was amazing. This place really deserve its Michelin stars, decor is modern and spacious. Location makes the experience very classy and elegant. Superbly looked after , service was attentive and friendly . Truly enjoyed every dish and the Caviar Egg is to die for . Only possible criticism is that the portion sizes are large for a tasting menu and I left feeling pretty full indeed . Amazing! I chose this restaurant to celebrate my graduation with the quintessential New York meal and was not disappointed. The traditional JG tasting menu was delicious with interesting tastes that were always delicious. The service was impeccable and the food or should I say edible art just kept coming and coming. I could have made a meal of the warm bread and butter alone.  The waitstaff were beautifully choreographed when delivering dishes and it was fun to see them pour sauces and slice meat. My little brother didn't have a jacket and the hostess subtly and without attitude gave him one to wear to fit the dress code. It fit perfectly. There was no snobbery, just wonderful food and service. I look forward to returning to celebrate another special occasion. We came here for a birthday dinner and we were not disappointed. The decor and ambiance were lovely, and it had the perfect balance of traditional and modern - much like the food. Our server, Simone, was very friendly, attentive, and helpful. The rest of the waitstaff was also very attentive and polite - as to be expected from the quality of this restaurant. We ended up getting the chef's tasting menu and the seasonal menu. For us, the seasonal menu was overall much better, though there were highlights to both. Here were our thoughts: Amuse Bouche. The strawberry and cucumber were nice, interesting flavor pairing. The salmon was very nice and very fresh - it was so deep red that I initially mistook it for tuna. The miso cucumber yogurt was less interesting to us. Caviar. The traditional menu caviar with egg is nice but a touch salty. Still, it's a really nice taste and a great way to start. We preferred the seasonal menu's caviar - paired with lemon gelee and creme fraiche, all combined, made for a really nice flavor profile. The seasonal menu's Madai sashimi was really excellent, so good with the pickled cherries and the cilantro sauce. I liked the young garlic soup with frog legs from the traditional menu - maybe a little salty, but they worked well together. It was like drinking garlic bread, and really perfect with the frog legs. The seasonal menu's squash ravioli with basil sauce was by far our most favorite dish. The little ravioli burst with flavor and it was just so good with the sauce. We could eat this all day. The traditional menu's turbot was excellently cooked, really tender and moist and really good with the chateau Chalon sauce. The lobster on the seasonal menu was a bit better, we felt - the butter is really good with the lobster, and the gnocchi terrific. The squab and foie gras from the traditional menu were very nice, especially the latter with the corncake. The traditional menu's molten lava cake portion of the dessert is perfect for anyone who loves chocolate. Definitely eat it with the vanilla ice cream. Overall, we had a lovely evening eating this delicious food. While it did not wow me as much as my first time at JoJo's many years ago, it's clear that Jean-Georges is the top of the bunch. Next time, we'll be coming here for the prix fixe - so many tasty-looking dishes on that side of the menu that we wanted to try. KenScale: 8.5/10 Jean-Georges, one of the most venerable restaurants in New York with countless accolades, praises and awards. It was also one of the first restaurants that opened my eyes to the culinary greatness of NYC. The last time I visited the restaurant was for a lunch nearly four years ago (paid for by my employer when I was a summer intern there being wined and dined). Still a student back then who lived mostly on Subway sandwiches, I was just completely overwhelmed by the sophistication of the food from the restaurant. How do I feel about the restaurant four years later, having been to more than 150 restaurants in the city? I've always wanted to re-visit Jean-Georges again, especially during lunch time (when the price of the meal becomes a lot more affordable, with two-course meal starting at $38 per head with $19 per additional dish). I was finally able to make a visit last weekend and see if I could relive that memory from four years ago. The verdict: Jean-Georges is still a great restaurant, but it felt a bit short of my sky-high expectations.  The food from the world famous chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten is rooted in French origin but draws global influences from all over the world, especially from Asia (his wife is a Korean who is also featured with her husband in a documentary praising the greatness of kimchi). Such eclectic vision already showed in the amuse-bouche, featuring a bite with sticky rice and Korean chili-flavored soup. For starters, I tried sea urchin along with jalapeno and yuzu on top of bread, sea scallops with cauliflower and foie gras boule with rhubarb, pineapple \"raisins\" and Sichuan peppercorn. All of the dishes were well thought out and executed, especially the scallops. On the other hand, however, I felt all the dishes, despite the fascinating list of ingredients, somehow lacked the wow-factor that I was expecting. My feeling of reservation continued in the main dishes as well. While I had an extremely high expectation for the awesome-sounding parmesan crusted organic chicken with artichokes, basil and lemon butter, it was more like an above-average chicken dish. I felt the same way for black bass crusted with nuts and seeds immersed in sweet and sour jus. Definitely a really good black bass dish, just not to the transcendental level that I was expecting. For desserts, I tried the chocolate set with a bunch of chocolate ice cream and cake dishes and the rhubarb set with a couple of rhubarb-based savory dishes. Both of them were really outstanding (admittedly, slightly more so than the dishes I had prior to dessert).  Getting a reservation could still be a challenge at this restaurant, but it gets a lot easier during lunch time. Even though the dress code requirement has loosened somewhat, the restaurant still bans jeans and sneakers during lunch time, so be prepared to dress up a little. The restaurant has a huge selection of wine, as well as some classic cocktail menus. I can't say what it is like during dinner time, but the aura of the restaurant during lunch time when I visited had that surprisingly chill yet classy vibe. Jean-Georges is still a great place to visit, especially during lunch time when you want to feel pampered without breaking the bank. Perhaps I should visit for a dinner at some point in my life to see if their offering is way better. Until then, I'm inclined to stick to my 8.5 KenScale / 4.0 (definitely 4.5 if I can give half more points) Yelp rating. Lovely Memorial Day lunch here. Recommend the madai sashimi, diver scallops and black sea bass. Chocolate dessert tasting was yummy, rhubarb just a-ok. Very wonderful dining experience in NY. Solid food all around and food was very plentiful--even for the prix fixe. I have no idea how people manage to eat a tasting! Great vegetarian options, and they truly try to accommodate your every desire! Still think I prefer the decor/service at Daniel, however. hamachi sashimi santa barbara sea urchin arctic char crispy suckling pig service is right on point considering the prices and the 3 michelin star rating. good first time trying sea urchin hamachi sashimi is excellent. seconds of bread with housemade butter complementary petit fours with housemade marshamallow squares. food was overall good but was surprisingly...underwhelming. needed to drink 2 glasses of water after the meal with all the hidden salt. Tried out Jean-Georges's pre-fixe menu in the casual dining area, was pleased by their comfortable coat check service and the appealing interior design of the restaurant. If you like Riesling, go ahead with the German label (forgot the name smh) it was sweet, crisp, slight dry and was just absolutely delicious. The pre-fixe menu was very nicely priced (I believe $38? For 3 courses) and good portions too, you will leave satisfied. Next time I hope to try their fine dining menu, I'm excited for a guaranteed new experience! I'm not really big into shelling out an exorbitant amount of money for tiny portions of food so I tried the lunch pre-fixe. Going with a group of people, I was able to sample different appetizers and entrees. Appetizers ordered:  Sea Urchin Corn Ravioli with a Basil Sauce Entrees: Black Sea Bass Crispy Confit of Suckling Pig with Corn Polenta Veal Freebies: Strawberry Wasabi Soup Green Peas and Cream on Toast Salmon and Avocado Raspberry Macarons and a variety of chocolates Marshmallows My favorites were the corn ravioli and suckling pig. The corn for both of those dishes was amazing and the pig had a nice crispy outside. The other dishes were so-so. I feel like they overpowered the taste of sea-urchin by adding so much spice and lemon juice to it. The sea bass was good for the first few bites, but after a while it was way too salty. The veal tasted like ham. I did enjoy the freebies they gave us, mainly because it was free. Macarons and chocolates were my favorite part. Service was really good as expected. The waiter was attentive and described every dish to us before we ordered and when it was served. The staff also made sure we had enough bread and cleaned up the crumbs before the entrees were served. We came here to celebrate my birthday and were very impressed with the entire experience. This was our first Michelin 3 star restaurant so we were not quite sure what to expect. We knew that everything was going to be over the top, and it delivered! The decor is VERY fancy, but definitely NOT stuffy - everyone is dressed very well but you do not get the feeling that anyone is uncomfortable. I would describe it as simple, modern elegance; the bathroom is spotless but could use a bit more light. The staff is extremely attentive, friendly, and ready to fulfill any request that you have. They also know the menu inside and out (which is impressive because I had no idea was some of the items were). Last, but definitely not least, is the food. Being my first French restaurant I was delighted at the offerings - there really was something for everyone. We had the three course pre fixe (all people have to order the same, either the 3course pre fixe or the 7course tasting) so we each were able to get different items. For our 3courses we had: the scallops and sashimi, the risotto and the shrimp, and finally the duck, and the beef tenderloin. All were perfectly prepared and exquisitely presented; the only thing is I wish there was more of everything... but I expected there to be small servings of amazing items. To finish out the meal they bombarded us with desserts - not only a \"fourth course\" of desserts but bite-sized chocolates and a fantastic little single-serving chocolate moose birthday cake that was insanely dense and completely stuffed me. This was a meal unlike any we have ever experienced and I certainly would recommend it for anyone looking for something special. However, given the small portions, something I'm sure is standard for any restaurant of this type, I don't know that we would come back again. Honestly, I blame ourselves... I think some of it is just kind of lost on us since we really are not \"foodies\" and probably just have not developed a sophisticated enough pallet to fully enjoy all that they offer. Outstanding, indulgent lunch today: gorgeous, sun-flooded main dining room with snow-spangled park and buildings glistening outside; warm, smiling, uber-solicitous service; meticulously prepared, beautifully composed/plated, and sublimely delicious food with vibrant, clear, pure flavors.  Given the frigid temps outside, I warmed up with the peekytoe crab risotto: creamy and briny-sweet yet shot-through with a fresh chile zing, festooned with shreds of nori and dill and squirted with an acid jolt of key lime. My main was roasted sweetbreads, topped with crisped chestnut slices and surrounded by a pool of musky truffle vinaigrette - succulent, tender and richly flavored. I finished with the \"Chocolate\" desert tasting which arrived in a tri-partite plate, showcasing milk chocolate panna cotta with piedmont hazelnuts, smoked salt meringue and candied orange; a little molten chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream; and white chocolate ice cream with yuzu sorbet. With a glass of Domaine de la Bergerie, Brut, NV, Crmant de Loire (poured from a freshly-opened bottle), coffee, tax & tip, tab (we did the $48 two-plate option) came to $115 p/p - well worth every penny. I wanted to experience the best New York City had to offer, and Jean-Georges is obviously rated as one of the best, so I took it for a spin. One of the most impressive aspects was the service. I know that people aren't always interested in the service however, if you want to feel like you are royalty, the staff at Jean-George will do that for you. I chose the pre-fixed menu, and enjoyed a few complimentary starters before we dug into our four course meal. The seared foie gras was out of this world, and to this day the best foie gras I have ever had. Next I had the salmon, covered with garlic and jalapenos, which was another amazing dish. Last I had the suckling pork, which was medicare, but still a very tasty dish. All in all I enjoyed the first two courses the most, however, I am not a snob, the food here is top notch. Lastly, do I think it's worth the money? You know what you are getting into when you go to Jean-Georges, yes it is worth the money, and you will be reminded why numerous times throughout the night. The food, service and the presentation is flawless every time I go. Their desert menu is over the top. the price is good for the entire package menus. Pure perfection.  Kaliq (my husband) and I have been here twice for lunch and Jean-George is probably in our top 10 dining experiences.  The food, the service, the experience was perfect and to be expected from a 3 Michelin star restaurant. My girlfriend and i stopped by Jean Georges for lunch during our trip to New York in late March. What a memorable experience! This restaurant is the most affordable lunch option of any of the 3-michelin starred restaurants in the city, it's definitely a strong recommend if you're in the area. We both opted for the 2-course taste of spring menu (additional courses available at additional cost). The meal began with an amuse bouche trio of a pea flan on carrot puree, broccoli soup with chili foam and pickled rhubarb on sushi rice. It was my first time trying any of the sort but each was marvelously delicious. For our first course, i opted for the yellow fin tuna ribbons. The dish was as beautiful as it was tasty, a testament to chef Vongerichten. The bed of avocado, yuzu sauce and radish provided nice contrast with the fish, a perfect balance of delicate flavors. My girlfriend had the Uni (served with yuzu on black toast) - we had never had sea urchin served this way before and it was absolutely phenomenal. As for the main course, i went with the black sea bass (crusted with nuts and seeds), served over sweet & sour jus. Some of the best cooked sea bass i've had. My girlfriend had the salmon crusted with black truffle, which i must admit i enjoyed even more than my own selection.  Lastly, we proceeded with the chocolate dessert tasting. Warm chocolate cake, vanilla bean ice cream, milk chocolate custard with candied orange and yuzu sorbet on white chocolate crumbles. We fell in love with every bite and in conjunction with the selection of petits fours (as well as the home-made vanilla bean marshmallows), the dessert successfully capped off a simple and elegant lunch.  The waitstaff was friendly and courteous, providing descriptive explanations with the presentation of each dish. Our server even packed us a box of extra marshmallows to take home (since we were such big fans!).  The main dining room is one of the most beautiful i've had the pleasure of dining in and really highlights the experience in its entirety. Simple, elegant, perfect would be choice words to encapsulate the extent of our dining experience here.  One of our absolute favorite places to enjoy a meal in NYC and we will definitely be back next time! Amazing ambience, service, and food! We had the bruleeized foie gras (bomb), uni on toast with yuzu jam, egg yolk caviar toast (a must get) , scallops (delish!), hake (not good), nishiki risotto (interesting lemongrass flavor), and crispy pork belly (super yum!!). We also tried one of the green smoothies -Pineapple mint (kale spinach and all the goodies) but was disappointed as it come in plastic bottle form brought in by another supplier, Heartbeet. It should have been made fresh from Jean Georges itself.  Overall, we had a wonderful dining experience here! Jean-Georges is one of the must go in food lovers list. I take my girl friend here for a special night. Even with the high price, it worth every penny. The staff is world class, respectful and helpful. Food is amazing, will go back again if visiting nyc. You know how they say that your mood can change the perception of a place but trust me the fact it was our 1st wedding anniversary or the fact that my husband made sure my evening was full of surprises, this place is definitely worth 5 stars. So it doesn't look anything out of heaven or anything but the food and the service and is definitely out of the world. So I am not a vegetarian and they do not have a vegetarian tasting menu. But they were so nice to offer to make a 7 course vegetarian tasting menu just for me. Infact I told them that I don't prefer mushrooms except truffle and they even took that into acct. All my dishes had tons of mushrooms and needless to say, the presentation and the flavors were spot on. So beautiful. Service was crazy good. I mean I can go on and on but I will run out of words. They gave us a nice complimentary anniversary dessert too. Nice of them. Definitely expensive, but worth every penny. Do dress up, I think the place says jacket required. Definitely a great choice to celebrate occasions. Where do I even begin? The fact that I didn't open a single door to make my way into this place and to my seat, is just the tip of the iceberg. You will feel like a VIP from the second you walk through those doors, to the second you walk out. This is an experience you have to try.  They have three different prix fixe choices, all of which are amazing. We went with the regular prix fixe and I had the scallops, risotto and beef tenderloin, with the citrus menu for dessert. All of it, was outstanding. Not one thing was better than the other. Everything was bursting with flavor, you could taste every single ingredient and every bite was better than the last. Of the three, the risotto was my favorite. Basic dish, but something about the way it was cooked, with the little kick at the end, was amazing. The dessert really ended the meal perfectly. You can't even imagine how many different ways you can include one theme/flavor into so many different dishes. It really was one of the best meals I've ever had.  As you could image, service is impeccable. They perfectly time the way they put the dishes down on your table, to the way they pull your table out when you go in and out from your seat. Your glass will never be empty and you'll never have to wait for some help. Definitely an experience you have to try and the food is just amazing. However, you will get extremely spoiled with the way they cater to you, it may change your dining experience forever! Well I don't know where to start because the meal was truly mind blowing and phenomenal. The moment we walked in to the moment we walked out was just out of this world. We were taken care of, paid attention to, and the food was out of this world. We did the autumn tasting menu and it was excellent. Couldn't be any happier. It was a three hours long meal however, with good food, wines and friends? It felt like 1 hour. The atmosphere was cozy, intimate and comfy. The staff were super attentive, professional and well trained. The service here was amazing. We got the free pre appetizer app and it was the best soup I've had in a while. The first and second app proceeded to be amazing. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because of my main entre. I paid $40 extra for the Wagyu beef in the prix fixe menu, only to find it to be the biggest disappointment of my night.  They marinated it in some sauce that was way too salty. Wagyu is such a high quality cut that even the simplest sear would've been delicious. Such a shame.  The chocolate desserts were the highlight of my night. Would come again but hope my entree would be better. Hello all, I just had a wonderful lunch at Jean-Georges today and thought I would detail my experience here. RESERVATIONS: A pretty easy process. I used the online system to try and secure a lunch reservation just a few weeks in advance of a date, and didn't have any trouble finding a time. I am not sure if dinner is much more complicated, but a lunch at Jean-Georges seems fairly easy to come by as long as you don't wait until the last minute.  DRESS CODE: For lunch, \"business casual\" seemed appropriate. Most people had on slacks and nice shoes, but a jacket didn't seem necessary for guys. I even saw a few women walk in wearing jeans and they were sat on the bar side, though I'm not sure if the formal dining room allows jeans so avoid jeans and sneakers if you can.  SERVICE: This was quite excellent. Our servers were very friendly and seemed to know quite a bit about the dishes they were recommended. Since our group was mostly first-timers, we asked for several recommendations and I was pleased that our server genuinely seemed to be advising on items she liked the most. I find in some other situations that servers will either recommend everything on the menu or the most expensive items. She focused on a handful of recommendations and very few had a supplemental charge. All of our needs were attended to and there didn't really seem to be a lag in the flow of our dishes. Plus, we were never without bread for the entire meal! FOOD: This was outstanding. For lunch, we each ordered the two course option and added on dessert. I had the pea soup with parmesan (it wasn't listed on the online menu) and it was perfect. I only got a bite of the scallops starter from a friend, but it was quite great. I did have a friend who had the gulf shrimp starter that she called \"salty\" so maybe try something besides those. For our main courses, the sea bass came strongly recommended and a few of my friends ordered that. I got a bite and the fish was really well prepared with a lovely seasoning, and it was served in bowl surrounded by vegetables in a rich broth. Wonderful. I ordered the arctic char which came with a black truffle crusting, and I was incredibly happy with it. The fish was cooked perfectly and the truffle topping was rich without being overwhelming. Finally, one of my friends had the veal and I had a really rich, tasty bite of that. For dessert, almost all of us had the chocolate tasting which I would recommend. Though one guy got the rhubarb tasting and loved that also.  We also got a few freebies...a little taste of parsnip soup with a bit of salmon, and some extra treats with dessert. DRINKS: I had the cucumber martini (hey, I'm on spring break! Day drinking is ok!) and it was incredibly smooth and refreshing.  Overall, I loved lunch here! If you're hoping to experience a three Michelin restaurant without blowing past $100, this is the place. Ahem. Dinner perfection. Dined here in May for the first time. I understand the menu changes seasonably or perhaps even more often. What I ate: Amuse Bouche - 3 small tastes. Each oddly different than anything I've had before. Country french bread w/butter Diver Scallops, Caramelized Cauliflower, Caper-Raisin Emulsion Risotto with Peekytoe Crab, Nori and Key Lime Grilled Rack of Lamb, Smoked Chili Glaze, Spring Onion and Tatsoi Rhubarb Dessert Tasting For drinks, everything was chosen by Dad, who has an amazing pallete. I honestly can't remember, but their wine list is enormous and crme de la crme. Best meal I've had in NYC, granted I only visit for a week or so a year. Lives up to the hype. 10/10. My girlfriend and I had a wonderful lunch meal in their dining room. Service was top notch and extremely well-paced. Food was excellent and very reasonably priced for such a high end restaurant.  I took away a single star because there was a mixup with our to-go box. We asked to have our petit four and vanilla bean marshmallow boxed because we were way too full. They packed everything up and gave us our box with our coats, but a few hours later we found out we had gotten someone else's meal. My girlfriend and I really wanted to try the petit four so we returned to the restaurant explaining what had happened. They quickly gave us a new box but did not include and marshmallows or macaroons. Unfortunate, but we didn't want to push this any further.  Mixup aside, Jean-Georges was overall excellent and my girlfriend and I will definitely be returning to try their dinner menu. Perfect dining experience -- especially for lunch which is a great deal in the main dining room. I recommend the foie gras brulee and the veal. The classic tuna ribbon is excellently prepared and has a presentation unlike any tuna tartare like dish I've had. The parmesan chicken breast is also a classic solid dish. Service is amazing and attentive. They definitely know how to make sure you feel taken care of. The complimentary desserts are amazing and make you rethink the need for one of their more decadent items. I haven't dined at Jean Georges in many years, but when someone I respect tweeted that he had one of his finest meals ever at JG, I knew that I had to move JG to the top of my \"bucket list\". Surprisingly enough when I was browsing OpenTable yesterday afternoon, JG had an availability at 6:00. Called the restaurant and made the reservation.  I chose the Spring Menu, and asked whether it would be possible to substitute the seared foie gras for the listed halibut course, and after a quick check with the kitchen, was told that it would be no problem. Dinner had all of my favorite luxury items: caviar, foie gras and lobster. Almost as many mignardises as at Per Se.  Long story short: almost 3 hours of a nearly flawless dinner. Food was delicious; service (especially by my captain, Andrew) was the best in comparison to my previous 4 visits (which while I had found to be proper, Iacked the warmth of many of the other top restaurants). Even opted for the additional cheese course.  Based on last night's dinner, I plan to dine more frequently at Jean Georges. I came here for lunch with a friend before she left New York on the recommendation of another friend of mine. The lunch menu I think presents a great value - Prix Fixe two courses for $48 (dessert is around $12), or a tasting menu for $158. We opted for the Prix Fixe; I had the sea trout and oyster tartar and the veal scallopine with flying pig ham, and finished with the dessert tasting menu.  The overall presentation of the restaurant is very modern, and the atmosphere is very moody depending on passing clouds since during lunch, since it aspires to be naturally lit. The so-called \"views of central park\" aren't much, since it's on the corner of central park, but it is still quite nice and vegetative/green outside. The restaurant has you seated in booth-like seats. Plenty of people getting drinks in the bar area when you first walk in. Presentation-wise, the waiter was very nice and helpful and came by at just the right time to offer us drinks and take our orders. Not in the mood for a glass of one of their many champagnes and wines, I chose a cherry yuzu soda, which was delicious and delightfully reminded me of a yuzu/gin cocktail I had earlier in the week.  The sea trout and oyster was very well done, and the oyster added some very interesting texture to the dish. The portion was very generous and came with some toasted bread -- the bread itself was probably as good as the tartar, very well seasoned. I also tried some of my friend's tuna strips -- they were coated in a very interesting cherry sauce, but what stood out the most to me was the vivid red colour they were. Truly good-quality fish. My second course was the veal scallopine, which came coated in a mushroom/vegetable mixture and a giant slice of bacon. I have to say, although it was pretty heavy for lunch, the bacon was delicious and crisp, just the right amount of fat and oil to complement, but not overwhelm, the flavour of the veal. The veal itself was very well-cooked, tender yet firm. As someone who has tried to cook veal scallopine before, I appreciate how difficult it is to get the right level of done-ness for a very thin slice of meat.  The dessert menu was also great -- although they didn't have their strawberry-themed desserts, I ordered another tasting platter that included concord grape sorbet, apple sorbet and some pastry crumbles. The apple sorbet/pastry crumble combination reminded me of an apple pie, but in sorbet form.  Overall it was a great experience and I'd look forward to returning for lunch again, and possibly dinner as well. Lunch at around $60 is a great deal for some place like Jean-Georges (I've easily spent close to that in West Village or Soho). Me and my boyfriend went there for our anniversary and we didn't make a reservation in advance. Still we were welcomed warm and they seated us soon. The hostess and server were really polite and nice. It turned out we caught the first day of restaurant week and they had a rw combo set already for fair price. As we were new to JG we got one of each rw options. That tomato soup with shredded cheese and crouton was just ah-mazingly delicious, just impeccable. The entree was a flounder with chili peppers and ppumpkin seeds I think and was cooked just right. We finished it with some beer and wine and of course desserts. Their chocolate souffle is the best that I can only compare it to Veniero's. I will definitely come back for a lunch or brunch. We found free parking spot just two blocks away. Recommend to all! The food is perfect and the ambience is upscale. Waiters are polite and professional. For anniversary and birthday. Perfect place to go! Happy birthday my dearest Tian. The wine taste is fabulous! Every expectation I had of Jean-Georges was exceeded during a recent Saturday lunch. I know a lot of people have preconceived notions of what this dining establishment will be - stuffy, uptight, overpriced - but it is NOTHING of the sort.  When you walk in, there is a warm greeting from the host and hostess who are gracious and welcoming. Once in the dining room, the service is flawless and so well coordinated, that it has an almost dance-like quality. No need is overlooked and everyone is completed focused on making your meal a true experience. Now on to the real star, the food! We started with the sea scallops with caramelized cauliflower and nishiki risotto with peekytoe crab. Both were outstanding. As an additional dish, we tried the goat cheese royale with roasted beet marmalade and crushed pistachios. This was the only dish that I thought was just okay. Creative and unusual? Yes. I appreciated the pistachios adding a great texture and salt component, but overall the flavors didn't come through enough. It may have been the way the dish was plated, but the ratio of goat cheese to beets was a bit out of whack.  For mains, we had black sea bass crusted with nuts and seeds, as well as the parmesan crusted chicken with artichokes, basil & lemon butter. Both of these dishes were incredible. The sea bass comes over a sweet and sour jus, which has mushrooms and pearl onions. Not only is the flavor of this jus delicious, but the fish was cooked to perfection. By this course, I was feeling quite stuffed between the dishes, bread offerings, and amuse bouche, but you power through it. For dessert, we split the Chocolate plate. It is absolutely delicious and in addition to your dessert offering, you also receive a small plate of petit fours, which are quite miniature but oh so delicious.  In addition to all the food options, I also enjoyed a few of the ginger margarita. In the spirit of full disclosure, I drink a decent amount, especially tequila. This drink is incredibly strong and I couldn't detect any overly assertive tequila flavor which tells me that whatever tequila they're using is a very high quality and it is impeccably balanced with the ginger. More than two of these and you will likely be stumbling out the front door, with a full stomach and smile on your face. We finally visited Jean-Georges this past weekend. I absolutely love fine dining establishments, especially when they live up to their name and public expectations. The staff is incredibly attentive, accommodating, and very friendly. It's evident that they take their roles seriously and I appreciate that.  Our afternoon went like this: Appetizers of Risotto (peeky-toe crab, nori, & key lime) and Santa Barbara Sea Urchin (black bread, jalapeo, and yuzu. We preferred the Risotto as all of the flavors were a try compliment to each other, truly amazing!. The sea urchin was creamy and the jalepeno a nice, welcomed surprise. Our main course consisted of Roasted Wild Hake (tender celeriac and jade emulsion). We love Hake, it's very similar to cod but tastier in my opinion. Once again the jalapeo (which isn't mentioned in the description on the menu) was a surprise, not the most pleasant of surprises either. I would have liked to have known it was spiced prior to ordering. The fish was still delicious and technically perfect.  I will absolutely be back and look forward to trying other dishes. great food, great service. don't remember exactly what I ate just remember everything being excellent Jean-Georges... Superb. Exquisite. Sublime.  A place where you feel hugged by the culinary angels as soon as you take the first bite.  The memory of my lunch at Jean-George will stay with me until the day I die.  I celebrated my 30th birthday with my husband at Jean-George. I can confidently say that we had the best table in the main dining room. We ordered the multi course tasting menu and we were delighted with our choice from the moment that the amuse bouche arrived. We knew we were in for a treat and would not be able to get enough of the food. For $158/person, the food and the experience is worth so much more. Great wine selection too, of course.  In addition to the dessert course, I also got my very own chocolate birthday cake The service is one of a kind. From the moment we arrived until our departure, we noticed and admired the world-class demeanor of the staff.  Three Michelin stars, well deserved! Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten is an absolute genius. Some of the best dishes I ever had: Yellowtail tuna. Best sashimi hands down Fo grias w strawberry; so delicious and not fattening at all Suckling pig: good Strawberry desert: mind blowing I think I appreciate the Asian influenced dishes as I can sincerely appreciate the execution.  The service was great but maybe it's my inexperience at 3 michilin star restaurants. The waiter and waitress look so serious that I feel they r totally out of character and are somehow forced to act in a proper way. I end up feeling a little bad for them. =( I got a six courses menu for lunch tasting and the experience was awesome! and this was my first time dining in a restaurant with three stars michelin At times both captivating and too quiet, the service provided at Jean-Georges is ultimately extraordinary. It's a full-service crew restaurant that tend to your every move, with someone responsible for describing the dishes, another for assisting in wine pairings, and plenty more to help carry plates back and forth. I say \"too quiet\" specifically in response to our primary waiter, though. The room itself was never loud, but he may have been a bit too soft-spoken for me to hear him well enough. Very kind, but I had difficulty hearing just our main man speak. The food itself was exquisite. I ordered two dishes: shrimp with fried artichokes & crackled mushroom, and suckling pig with smoked bacon marmalade. I probably liked the shrimp dish slightly more, but man-oh-man, when the option to *TRY* bacon marmalade comes up, you take it! Desserts were also served to my date and I, which were decent but not memorable and a bit overkill. Mine was chocolate-based, but I wish I had gotten the one focusing on \"late harvest,\" inclusive of pear. If there were better communicative techniques practiced, and the desserts were not so over-the-top, Jean-Georges could very well earn a fifth star. Jean-Georges has the same cred as many of its Michelin-starred peers, but I feel like it just might be towards the bottom of the totem pole.  I don't mean to shade the food because it was pretty delish...the Swedish rye bread was really interesting, the toasted egg yolk with cavi was mind-blowingly decadent, and the peekytoe crab dumplings might've been the best thing I've eaten in a while.  But what really knocked them down a few notches was our head waiter. The rest of the team was great, but he basically ignored us until he took our order, and even then forgot to ask what we were drinking. Our food arrived without utensils being set. Napkins weren't folded when we left the table. And he steered me away from ordering the signature strawberry dessert for this seasonal fig thing that was SO boring.  I really wish I could re-do the experience with a different server, because ours did the delectable cuisine an injustice. At $200 for the prix-fixe lunch menu for two people, a glass of wine each, coffee and two desserts (including tax and 19% tip), we had an incredible experience and a very memorable meal. The service was friendly and constant but not over bearing. Our table was within one of these little alcoves they have built along a wall, giving us a sense of privacy and view onto the sun-drenched dining room.  The food was delectable with a special mention for the duck confit (how did they make a duck so juicy?) and the foie gras (usually avoid this because it is so haughty but this was a sweet/savory miracle). The portions were filling (always a worry at fancy restaurants). The desserts were delicious -- and the special treat is the homemade marshmellows they serve at the end of every meal. Finest restaurant I have ever had the pleasure to dine in; dinner was more of an art gallery complete with introductions and descriptions from our server, and compliments from Jean-George himself, who personally prepared our courses. The caviar topped egg filled with vodka cream and scrambled egg was lovely and tasteful. My favorite dish was the muscovy duck with marshmallow-nut breading and sweet wine sauce. Muscovies are very common here in Florida (to the point where they're considered pests) and to finally sample a tender duck steak in such elegant context was a delightful experience. For dessert, we sampled the spring and chocolate menus. The perfectionism involved in making our dishes was stunning. Jean Georges has the best pre-fixe lunch menu in NYC. At $48 per person, you get an option of two dishes, which comes with amuse bouche prior to your food selection, and dainty chocolates, marshmallow, and macarons for at the end of your meal. Each additional dish you order is $24 a pop. It seems that they upped their price, this lunch option was $38 per person last summer when I came with friends.  The food here is amazing! With the lunch menu I was able to get a filling meal at a \"won't break your wallet\" price at a high-end three michelin star restaurant, to me that is a steal! This time around we ordered the: -Charred Corn Ravioli (with Heirloom Tomato Salad and Basil Fondue) -Spicy Peekytoe Crab Salad (with Frozen Honeydew, Lime and Mint) -Cod Steamed (with Honshimeji Mushrooms and Lemongrass Consomme) -Crispy Confit of Suckling Pig (with Baby Beets and Ginger Vinaigrette ) My favorites of the dishes were the Corn Ravioli - the basil sauce/soup it came in created the perfect balance for the sweet taste of the corn in the ravioli, and the Suckling Pig. I first tried the pig last summer, when my friend ordered it. A year later it is still hands down the best dish I've tried at JG, the $10 supplement for that dish is absolutely worth it. The Peeky Toe salad was good, there was a generous serving of crab meat. On top of the salad was a scoop of honey-dew sorbet, which was a great \"sauce\" for the salad, the combination of the salad and the ice cold melt was awesome. My least favorite part of the meal was actually my Cod, the fish itself was cooked perfectly, nice and tender, however I wasn't a big fan of the consomme, it was too sour for my taste. Regardless the meal was amazing.  Finally, I have to give some props to the amuse bouche: a cube of watermelon and ginger lime, a swig of tomato gazpacho, and the star of the show - the jalapeno fritter. Above all else, the jalapeno ball absolutely stole the show. The bits of corn and cream inside the fritter with a touch of chipotle mayo was uber noms, I only wish we could have ordered it as a dish for a part of our meal.  One last thing, the chili passion-lime soda I had was also very good. Every sip of the drink had a spicy aftertaste, it was surprising and enjoyable.  I can't wait to come back to JG for their lunch menu, I know it's just a matter of time. Hopefully the price doesn't go up again anytime soon! My husband and I have been here a few times for lunch and it is a great deal. We finally went this past Sunday for our anniversary. The service is superb. The food was delicious. The Parmesan crusted chicken on a bed of artichokes is delicious, especially with the lemon sauce! The ambience is wonderful in a great prt of the city. The fish, any kind we have had there, has been great. Enjoy! Last night I came here to celebrate my birthday, and I'm glad I did. The food was great as was the attentive service. We did the three course tasting menu (four when you include dessert), and standouts to us were: - yellowfin tuna (delicious and beautifully presented) - hamachi with radish (same sentiment) - parmesan crusted chicken stuffed with truffles on top of artichoke hearts (OMG delicious) For dessert we chose the chocolate and caramel plates (each dessert choice is a plate selection of four small desserts). The molten chocolate cake was phenomenal, but I wasn't blow away by the others. However, the pretty little birthday cake they brought me was quite good (dense chocolate). To end the meal they brought out homemade marshmallows and a large assortment of petit fours.  Would definitely go back! What kind of world would it be if Jean-Georges got less than 5 stars?  I would call it an interesting food experience, rather than a restaurant. If you eat as much as me, you will not leave full. Beautiful dining area, and the menu reminded me a lot of Top Chef ;) Servers were very attentive, and they willingly accommodate food allergies. Decadently fabulous anniversary lunch was top-notch from beginning to end. Everything--from our warm welcome to the amuse bouche to each delectable course of the 3-course summer tasting menu, drinks, wine, fantastic house-made breads, attentive service, desserts, and freebies--was everything we could've hoped for, and then some. Though portions are petite, they are artfully presented and worth savoring. Fresh flavors and vibrant colors made each course pop! Special kudos to servers Caitie and Caroline, both of whom remembered us from prior visits and made themselves especially helpful. Before we left, Chef J-G himself came out to shake our hands. Merci!! Perfect for romantic date or go for buttersquash soup during winter time! Best ever!! Possibly the greatest lunch I've ever had. All the food here is definitely worth the price, and the staff was professional and friendly, not at all pretentious. The cocktails were perfectly mixed. The amuse-bouches were all delightful surprises. I ordered the risotto and sea bass, and my husband got the shrimp and organic chicken. Everything was unbelievably delicious. The kind of food where you take a bite and have to sit back and process how wonderful it is. We also got the caramel dessert and were not disappointed. The cute little desserts on the house were a nice little touch to the end of a perfect meal. Choice of two dishes Of appetizers and main For thirty-eight dollars Really good deal for lunch. Setting and company is prestigious, pretentious New Yorkers. Good to experience for once. Very tasty dinner, we chose the full tasting menu and the autumn menu, so between me and my wife we tasted a good 16 courses plus various amouche-bouches. We give it four stars not because the food was lacking, but because for a three star Michelin restaurant we expected perfection. We had to send one lobster dish back, too salty to eat, which was painlessly replaced. For what you get, it's simply overpriced, and we found ourselves eating lots of their bread, which would have been nice to have served warm btw. Very good food, just not quite WOW. Food perfection. Warm contemporary ambience paired with flawless food and exceptional service. I always dine at the bar (Ian is a gem). This is my favorite bar to dine at in NYC (tied w/ Babbo). The wine by the glass is un paralleled. I recommend- Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict paired w/ a glass of Montrachet. We wanted to have a special meal for our last full day in New York and Yelp pointed us to Jean-Georges. For lunch, you can go with their tasting menu (about $150) or their two plates option with appetizer and entree (for just $38!). I say just because Jean-Georges has three Michelin stars so to be able to experience fine dining for just $38 is incredible!!! The central dining room was exquisite with floor-to-ceiling windows and natural lighting during lunch time. Make sure to request the central dining room if you want the formal setting when making reservations--the nougatine is the more casual sister and has more of a bar setting. Service was very, very impressive. We were attended to by multiple people, each dish was presented with a nice introduction, and we did not have to want for anything.  The menu changes with the seasons since they use local market ingredients as much as possible. For our appetizers, we tried the fried soft shell crab and foie gras with nuts and dried strawberries. Both were beautifully executed but if we had to choose which we preferred, it would be the crab. It was succulent, perfectly fried, and expertly seasoned. For our entrees, we got the black sea bass (signature dish!) and Arctic char. The Arctic char came in a green sauce reminiscent of a Thai curry and was nice and soft. It was quite good but paled in comparison to the bass...that's how good the bass was! It's indubitably one of the best restaurant dishes I have ever had. The combination of flavors and textures in that dish was absolutely stunning...I kept thinking that must be what Chef Ramsay means by \"finesse.\" The dish awoke all my senses and I wouldn't have been surprised if angels above sang with every bite I took! You get an amuse bouche at the beginning and a petit fours plate with housemade marshmallows, chocolates, mini macarons, etc. at the end. Everything about our experience was wonderful...Jean-Georges is a must if you are in NYC! Best food and cocktails I've ever had in my life! Came here for the 3-course lunch. Maybe the seasoning was a little *too* inventive for my palette but I didn't think it was great. The restaurant is beautiful and it's perfect for a summer day at the park afterwards, but the food didn't \"wow.\" I'd recommend Bouley instead. As soon as I walked into J-G I thought that the decor was excellent.  The white themed rooms reflected natural light exquisitely, and the chandelier in the main dining room was something to see. The service turned out to be similarly beautiful. Coordinated waiters serve food, remove plates, and set utensils all in unison, which makes the whole meal feel like an elaborate dance. The food itself was fabulous. I ordered from the taste of spring menu. Their advice advice as to which courses were lighter fare and which were heavier was helpful so that I could better gauge what I wanted to order. The courses themselves were stunning in both taste and presentation. The tuna appetizer was a highlight. Loved the dining experience, and will return! I was very skeptical of this place at first thinking michilen stars are given only to certain cuisines and for presentation but I was blown away. The food is some of the most flavourful i have ever had and becomes more and more delicious the more you chew it. The lamb in particular was delicous as was the gnocchi. To everyone who has the spending abality please do go at least once espicially if you live in the city. There are many foods that michellin stars don't reach as they tend to be awarded for excellence in a particular style of cuisine, but this is worth all three stars and I would highly recommend it. Daniel is also quite lovely but pure taste wise this place is very very good and unique. Only downside is that the bread is only really above average. We reserved a table for our 11th anniversary. It was a very exciting but at the same time soothing and calming dining experience. You know you are very well attended and taken care of for both food and service.  We had the Winter tasting menu. Though nothing screamed for attention, each dish was very well controlled and executed as expected. We also liked the fact that they serve wines in half portions for half the price (they do not allow half portions for wine paring unfortunately which would make more sense for me).  The way the menu is designed and food is prepared, I would come back here for dinner even on a regular day, whether at Nougatine or in the main dining room. It can suit to different tastes and occasions. The caramelized foie gras with spiced figs is the most perfect foie gras dish I have ever experienced. The entire meal, wine, and experience at Jean George was fabulous, however it was the foie gras that made it the most memorable. My friend and i celebrated my 20th birthday. I really had an unforgettable experience at this nice restaurant. I am so happy that they gave a tasty cake for my birthday for free. Each dish is amazing. I ordered Risotto ,Sea Trout and Oyster Tartari and dessert named autumn, and they taste awesome.  Sea Trout and Oyster Tartari are almost raw, but they are melt with chives and lemonade and they are tasty. And the service is so nice. This restaurant was on our list for a few years and we finally tried it last month. There's a lot of buzz about it so we had high expectations. The best restaurant we had ever visited was Victoria and Albert's in Orlando (Disney World actually) and to this day no place has topped in in both food and service. We thought maybe Jean Georges would be the one to at least match it, but although very good it just wasn't all that great. All the dishes (with the exception of the pasta special with shaved white truffles that was absolutely terrific) were very vinegary. The host/hostess were very arrogant (no reason to snub those who can afford this place so they should definitely lighten up, they don't own it, they work there). The servers were polite and did a good job at describing the dishes, however, the service was not coordinated well, certainly a little disheveled by comparison with other restaurants in the same level that deliver ballet-like perfection in synchrony. I think overall it is overrated. The price is not bad but I thought I would be happier with my experience there. Parking was easy though, right there in the same building and a bargain for Manhattan. The location is nice, in the Trump Towers and right across Central Park. But now I want to try another place like Daniel or Per Se and see if maybe there I will find my Manhattan Victoria and Albert's. The Holy Trinity Tome 2: Jean Georges is the 3-michelin star of manhattan. Seriously. There is obviously Per se -but they have a confusion of style- and i put eleven madison park into another category -they do transcend though. After thoroughly reviewing the other spots Jean Georges so meticulously created, here is the time for flagship. First the dining room is amazing. Obviously, Wherever you choose to sit, the bar, the casual tables beside the bar with the central park scenery, the tables with the open kitchen scenery, the more formal-looking back dining room or the outside. It is always the same. Amazing. The quality of the service is so as well. The people here are all so professional, friendly and they are qualified. They know what they are doing and well-picked. The menu is created with thought and art. So you can not go wrong with anything here. Be brave. Jean Georges is one of the american restaurants that reflects the french understanding of dining as good as humanely or otherwise possible.  What about my favorite dishes and recommendations? Obviously you should try the tasting menus but they do offer them a la carte in Lunch which is the best edible thing money can buy. The tuna ribbons and the sea scallops are my favorite appetizers -cause i love ginger and cauliflower is a nice twist with the seafood thing. For mains obviously you should go for the parmesan crusted chicken which is amazing -yes amazing. This is even better than the one that i had at perry st. which was perfect. You figure it out. The crust thing is so delicious and melts in your mouth. The veal scaloppine is another fave of mine and you should try that if you enjoy red meat. Obviously the foie gras, sea urchin... Dessert tasting makes Jean Georges even more appealing to me. Because you do not pick a dessert here, you pick a theme -a core, a flavor, for which i always pick chocolate surprise!- and there are 3 things that they bring in a big dish in different small spaces such as a white chocolate ice cream, moelleux au chocolat -you might call this chocolate lava cake or other stuff but it is moelleux au chocolat and it is delicious- and many other stuff. So it was perfect. Wine list is perfect. But the wines are all very special -creme de la creme of wines if you will. In case you might not go for a full bottle, their by the glass selections are way better their counterparts with more rose selections and better red wine. Cocktails are another plus though.They have raspberry bellini which was very creative as well as the big apple which fits the concept. I have to review Nougatine separately. Though i consider both to be Jean-Georges, equally creative and delicious and perfect. So. An amazing lunch or dinner or any meal that you want. How is it that a place that was once #1 in the world for me has dropped so low on the list of the 20+ Michelin-starred restaurants I've been to as of now. I returned for a three course lunch on January 2, 2012, not too long after they replaced their previous head chef. Unfortunately, all 5 of us walked away feeling like everything was just A-OK at best that day. From dry meat to bland food to unpalatable combinations of flavors, we experienced an array of culinary faux pas unforgivable for a THREE Michelin-starred destination. While I'm tempted to rate it a solid 3*, I can't help but hang on to the memory so deeply ingrained of my incredible 5* worthy first visit and wonder if I had either gone on an off day, a day when the true powers that be were just not present (on holiday, appropriately considering it was the day after the turn of the New Year).. or, maybe I had possibly just experienced some of the minor culinary bumps and scrapes that tend to happen during a major transition. Or maybe it's a lunch thing. It makes me feel a bit like the doting mother who can't accept that the child genius she thought she was gifted with got a C on what's meant to be an easy test. I'm now adjusting my rating to a 4* and will be writing an updated review with more emphasis on the individual dishes we sampled - soon. My new #1: Restaurant at the Meadowood in St Helena, Wine Country. Quoting from Barney Stinson: \"Legen....wait for it...Dary...Legendary\" Jean-George can cook!! With over one thousand reviews as of now, let me just make mine brief -:). The dinning room is airy and each table has its own captain. Each course is served by the equal number of waiting staff simultaneously, as if under a blitz attack -:). I would enjoy more with less waiting staff. The utensils and tableware are nice (Cipriani uses chipped plates!) and delicate that the coffee cup is easy to tip, and one of our mates did tip hers.  Two flies (one big and one small) visited our table at different times. They offer set menu only and suggests that your table stick with one kind of menu only (for ease of serving). Our dinner took a little over three hours.  The freebies and paid for are delicious and wonderfully presented. The Yellowfin tuna is sublime. The seared foie gras melted in my mouth but its the one I wished that I could have scooped out of my stomach after the dinner - haven't had this urge in a long long time.  The dessert has four themes (I think) : chocolate, cherry, strawberry and summer are all wonderful. The restaurant doesn't add on gratuity for a table of five. Btw, it's cheaper than in Shanghai I got their lunch pre-fixe menu. I had their Foie Gras appetizer. It was good though it wasn't the best. For the main entree, I got the Sautee Veal Scallopine. It was bland, I didn't really enjoy it. What really made me lose my appetite was that the waiter accidentally poured an ice cube into my plate when he was refilling my glass (though I had requested a water without ice earlier). The waiter just went by and did not bother to apologize. It's a disappointing three-star michelin establishment. I've experienced better somewhere else.  One star for the price. One star for the ambience. 4.5. ( and its rated comparatively to other M3 I have been!) I went here like 3 years ago after Met opening night, so we were already really tired , don't remember the details but it was awesome. Just not as good as 11 mad or le bernardin. TUNA RIBBONS. Get the tuna ribbons! Probably the best thing I've ever tasted.  Perfect experience. Went for lunch with a group of 7 and service was, as expected, impeccable. The tuna ribbons were by far the highlight of the meal. The dessert tasting menus were fun, decadent, and delicious.  Gael Green was at the next table over. Jean-Georges himself came out to say hello. I didn't expect him to be there, much less in a chef's coat working the kitchen. Ah Jean Georges, I have been waiting forever to try you and you did not disappoint me. Jean Georges is located on the ground floor of Trump tower, just off Columbus Circle and with close access to Central Park. The reception area was a little plain for such a fine establishment. Behind two tinted double doors sits a polished modern eatery. There is a full bar area for walk-ins, however, note it's a rather small bar (from what I recall, it seats 10-12). The dining room is open and light with modern touches everywhere. We were sat at a corner table that had a great view of the entire restaurant. A waitress promptly greeted us and made a few wine suggestions. We went with a nice young Bordeaux from the Margaux region and it drank very nicely. Amuse bouche was a watermelon cube with a Siracha flavored sauce on top (sincere apologies as I can't recall the actual sauce), Jalapeno cheddar bite, and a watermelon soup. Great pre-meal snacks to start our palette. For my first course, I decided on the Sea Scallops, wow, talk about packing tons of flavor in three bite-sized scallops! The caramelized cauliflower went beautiful with the caper sauce. My only complaint, and it's a teeny tiny one, is that I thought it was just a little salty. My second course was the Charred Corn Ravioli, served in a basil base, with tomato salad. The Ravioli was perfectly seasoned and I thought the basil base had just the right amount of flavor without being overpowering. I went with the Musovy Duck for my main, served with a small salad and adorable little turnips. WOW, easily one of the best Muscovy duck dishes I've had. It is served with an Amaretto jus so note this dish is on the sweeter side. I normally do not like sweeter entrees, but this dish had the perfect combination of sweet and savory. The serving size was quite large I had to share some. After our meal we were served with flavored sorbets to cleanse our palette. They were little tart for my taste but very refreshing indeed. The desserts are served tasting style. You have the choice of chocolate, fig, summer and strawberry. Whichever you choose, you will get everything in under that ingredient. I went with the summer, which included a refreshing shot of sparking plum soda made with Riesling; orange sponge cake served with apricot parfait; honey wheat cake with an almond flavored ice cream and a warm perdu with blueberry and peaches. I like the fact their desserts are very small in size, which means you can actually try a little bit of everything. At last, on our way out, the ladies in our group were given little take home chocolates (two piece box, milk and dark).  Throughout our meal the service was impeccable. Which for me, is big must for any fine dining establishments. The meal was $128 per person (not including beverages). It sounds like a lot but you get a lot of food, a pre-starter trio, 3-course meal, palette cleansing sweets, desserts, and a take home sweet treat.  I had a wonderful experience at Jean Georges and will definitely return the next time I'm in New York. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a fusion culinary experience with excellent service. Fine dining at it's finest.  My Manager and I met here for a business dinner and much has changed since the last time I was there.  In a good way.  Friendlier staff (if that's even possible, because the staff is always excellent here and go above & beyond what you might imagine) I'm Pescatarian, so I ordered accordingly. My manager ordered the tasters menu and some wine.  The ambiance is nice and quiet. (NO children) and mostly made up of clean furnishings with clean lines.  The bathrooms are immaculate and we all know how fussy I am over restrooms.  We had a wonderful dinner meeting and were on our way just a tad late to see a show. You really need about 2+ hours to enjoy your meal.  It's a very romantic place, ask to be seated in the corner. It offers much privacy for conversations. In my experience, I cannot tell you why everyone seems to love this establishment. It was okay at best. The staff are clueless snobs. Please explain to me while you are pouring a glass of champagne that you know nothing about, that you are somehow better than me. On top of their uncalled for attitude, they murmur everything to you.  Granted the environment is lovely due to the interior, the dish-ware was delicately beautiful, and the presentation was perfection.  Once tasting the actual food, I was beginning to look forward to the end of my meal, hoping that it was a moment away. All of the flavors clashed instead of creating a melody of wonder. The overly miniature, fit for an infant macaroons we were given alongside our dessert were the absolute most dreadful macaroons I have ever tasted. The macaroons were rubbery in the same texture as the marshmallows.  If you are looking for a pitiful excuse for fine dinning & service, you will enjoy this establishment. However, this is Manhattan, fine cuisine is all around. Do not fall for the smoke and mirrors that is Jean-Georges. If you are getting any kind of tasting menu, for the love of God pace yourself. Aside from the gorgeously cooked courses featured on the menu, the chef will throw in tasty treats to delight and surprise.  I would recommend getting plates with meats - I liked their vegetable options as well but they are no where cooked as nicely as the dishes with meat! I notified the restaurant that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and of course we were presented with a beautifully decorated chocolate cake in the shape of a wrapped gift. I was also given chocolate treats before I headed out, because \"the chef always wants to leave the ladies something extra.\" The service was of course, impeccable. Our server was beautiful and sharp - she knew the origin of every meat dish we ordered. The waitstaff synchronized their movements so that my plate and my boyfriend's plate were cleared off... at the EXACT SAME TIME. I'm wowed by the level of precision and grace - which definitely enhances the dining experience. Still as good as ever! Jean-Georges was our initial introduction to fine dining and all these years later it is still mind blowing! We had: Foie Gras with pistachios - tasted like dessert! Ribbons of Yellow Fin Tuna - delish Gulf shrimp - perfection Japanese Risotto - outrageous!!! Duck breast with jordan almond crust and amaretto sauce - like dessert so good Caramelized beef tenderloin with brown butter miso - melted in your mouth! Chocolate & Caramel desserts - delish! The service was terrific and the decor was elegant. We will definitely come back!!! Came here for lunch. For a 3 Michelin star restaurant I was expecting so much more.. Marea is so much better. The sea bass that everyone raves about is subpar. I've had way better fish before. The Arctic char was too buttery. The foie gras creme brle was underwhelming. The citrus dessert tasting was enjoyable. The cheesecake in that tasting was the worst of the 3 desserts. The petite four was stale. Only good thing was the ambiance and service. Fabulous fine dining experience. The food and service were equally exceptional. For dessert I recommend the chocolate plate! The dining room is also commendable great vibe for a special date or group celebration. We went for our anniversary and had a fantastic meal. Every detail was superb. The food was worth every penny. We loved the ambiance and presentation. We noted on our reservation that it was our anniversary and they presented us with a beautiful and decadent chocolate cake to celebrate. I cannot say enough about how wonderful our experience was. I would definitely recommend. Jean-Georges for any special occasion. Easily one of the best meals of my life, Jean-Georges exemplifies just how outstanding a world class restaurant can be. From the ambiance to the service to the cuisine itself, I found nary a flaw during my visit two weeks ago.  I'll highlight the food briefly:  - Diver scallops with caramelized cauliflower and a caper-raisin emulsion. I usually steer clear from capers and raisins, but in this configuration they were delicious. Capers were once described to me as \"little gasoline bombs\" and I really like that description, but often they're better as one element in a larger dish. If it weren't one of the top restaurants in New York City I would have licked my plate clean. - Autumn Salad with foie gras, porcini mushrooms, artichoke hearts and pecans. This was almost too much between the earthiness of the legumes and the intense richness of the foie gras, but...you know...somehow I managed to devour every last bit of it. - Crispy confit of suckling pig (topped with a thick cut of skin), rhutabaga \"pudding\" and smoked bacon marmalade. It was as incredible as it sounds. The pig was cooked perfectly, delicate, and filled with rich porcine sapor. The skin, \"pudding\" and the marmalade were excellent compliments. - Instructed to choose a flavor that would encompass our individual dessert plates, I chose chocolate. That molten chocolate cake...my god...amazing. There are smaller bites throughout the meal: an amuse bouche (three, technically), bread plate, palate cleanser before dessert (sorbet), and Mignardises. The kitchen even sent out an additional two complimentary desserts. Totally uncalled for, and we were already full, but who can turn down a giant slice of sour cream cheesecake with some kind of berry sorbet on top, and a large serving of butterscotch pudding!? We were quite humbled by that kind gesture. Again, it just goes to show that just because it's haute cuisine it doesn't have to feel stuffy or formal. The servers were really friendly and jovial, and made what should have been an austere occasion feel comfortable and fun.  Five stars. Will return soon. This is a review for thursday night dinner We really have no complaints. We loved the restaurant, our waiters, the drinks, and the dinner/dessert. I had the sashimi, hake, duck, and fig dessert. My wife is a vegetarian, and loved every course as well. The price was 400 dollars for the two of us with tip. We both had prix fixe and 2 drinks each. There is a more expensive chefs menu and you can obviously splurge on more expensive wines, but I thought this dinner was worth the price and I would definitely come back again and recommend the experience to anyone. This was some of the most incredible food I've had in the city. I ordered from the pre-fixe lunch menu. The amuse bouche was pretty great. I was particularly fond of the strawberry-wasabi part. I ordered the scallops and the veal. The scallops were pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of the sauce they used (tasted like mustard), but the scallops were perfectly cooked. The veal was phenomenal. The ham on top gave it a little salty crunch that was amazing. I also tried some of my friend's dishes. He ordered the risotto (fantastic) and the parmesan crusted chicken (melt-in-your-mouth). The desserts are equally delicious. I ordered the strawberry and tasted the chocolate. You can't go wrong with either. Sadly, Jean-Gorges was not everything I expected. I will first say that the decor is beautiful and the food itself was phenomenal. The prix fixe menu was brilliantly designed and everything came together wonderfully, but I expected a lot more from such a well-renowned restaurant. We had reservations but still had to wait for 20 minutes in an incredibly awkward bar area where there weren't enough seats for us to sit, so we had to stand behind the people at the bar which caused us to block the walkway for waiters. There was a seating/waiting area across the lobby at the entrance of the Trump Tower, but another group was already sitting there taking up all the chairs. The hostess invited us to wait in the area between the first and second set of doors, but since those doors are meant to control the flow of cold air from getting inside, that area would be filled with an incredibly strong gust of wind whenever someone opened the door which made that area unbearable, especially since they had already taken our jackets. After getting through the uncomfortable wait we finally got to see the main room which was wonderfully decorated. All the waiters and staff were incredibly friendly, but, again, for such a respected restaurant, I did not expect to have to question what was brought to my table multiple times. When we got the first dish, the amuse bouche, we were so taken aback by how delicious everything was...until I found a scale inside my tuna tartare. The menu had offered the substitution of a mushroom soup for truffle pasta (I don't remember what everything was called), so we both opted for that, but we instead received the mushroom soup. I would understand if I asked for an unusual substitution, but this was something their menu was offering as part of their prix fixe. When we eventually did get the truffle pasta, it was the best pasta I have ever had, so it was worth the wait. After all the kerfuffle, we ended at a large plate of many forms of desserts. I am not a fan of chocolate desserts and remembered getting something different from my boyfriend in terms of a dessert, but we were both presented with the same chocolate-filled plate. This confused me but was later informed that it was supposed to be complimentary because of all the mix-ups and mistakes during our meal, which was very considerate of them, except for the fact that they gave me a dish I did not order first, instead of giving it to me later as a sign that it was a complimentary dish. All in all, every dish was delightful and uniquely flavored. It is probably one of the best meals we have ever had, though I cannot give it a full 5 stars because my expectations did not have a margin of error that allowed for waiting in a busy hallway, finding a scale in my fish, and receiving the wrong dish multiple times. I'm glad we had the opportunity to give Jean-Georges a try but will probably not be coming back any time soon. within minutes of checking-in to jean-georges (located in trump hotel), i was very impressed that 3 people wished me a happy birthday. we were then seated at a table in the middle of the dining room, which gave me a good view of the staff and their well-choreographed operation. i was also most excited about being seated at a 4 top (instead of the usual 2) because we always order plenty of food. from the pre-fixe lunch menu, we ordered the diver scallops, peekytoe crab risotto, black bass, and veal scallopine, and later ordered the chocolate dessert, which actually came with 4 desserts! given the multiple flavors that ran through each of our dishes, it's clear why jean-georges is so highly-rated. i felt like one of those cooking show judges excitedly picking out the next flavor that would hit my palate. the sauce that came with the black bass was so good that i probably broke all the rules by eating that dish as a soup, but i didn't care. i was not going to miss out on how well the sweet, tart, earthy vegetables, and fish all came together in one bite. also, who knew lime, dill, and nori would work so well with crab and risotto?! and caper + raisin with scallops?!  i also loved that the shape of the dishes were whimsical and sometimes heart-shaped, and the utensils were actually a size that could fit in my small hands! when we asked our waitress to take 1 photo of us, she was very kind to take a few on my camera and phone. for a dining experience like this, i was happy to dress up as jean-georges is listed as \"jacket-required\", but i'm not surprised that given how classy and courteous the staff was, this dress code was not enforced.  jean-georges offers a great value with their pre-fixe lunch and dessert menu. i would definitely come back again for another special occasion. Jean-Georges was excellent, the epitome of fine dining. Having lunch there made me understand why it is so well-liked. Every aspect of the experience was refined, not just the flavor of the food but also the presentation on the plate, as well as the atmosphere and the service that was offered by the wait staff (they placed and removed plates and utensils in unison).  I found pretty much all aspects of my meal quite memorable and very delicious. The cocktail/soup amuse bouche which was refreshing and light, but savory with a hint of spice for an added pop. My appetizer was the sea urchin on black bread with jalapeno and yuzu. I have never really had sea urchin in a non-Asian context (e.g. omakase, kaiseki, etc...) but this was pretty spectacular; the creaminess of the uni was well balanced by the acidity of the yuzu and the jalapeno slice added the perfect hint of spice. My main course was the sea bass crusted with nuts and seeds in sweet and sour jus. Again, this was another great dish, rich and creamy with the nuts and seeds in the sea bass crust adding a whole other element of flavor. The dessert, which was stone fruit gelee, almond crunch ice cream, honey whole wheat cake, pain perdu, blueberry jam and lemon thyme roasted peaches, was a refreshing and sweet but not too overbearing end to the meal. Petit fours which included tiny macaroons, various chocolates, blackcurrent jelly and house made marshmallow, were both cute and tasty rounding off an excellent experience.  Lunch at Jean-Georges was a pretty good deal at $48 for two plates, amuse bouche, and petit fours (dessert was extra). Although I can't say that I would be willing to pay for the significantly more expensive dinner service, I'd definitely be willing to come back for lunch! We arrived for our 5:30pm reservation at 4:45pm. We took a seat at the bar but were told it would not open till 5pm. The dining room still had people from the lunch seating as well.  5pm we were served drinks, Nougatine and the bar itself were packed by 5:15pm. 5:30pm they began seating. It felt kind of cool, like all of the people for the main dining room were connected, as if meeting somewhere to go together like a class trip or something.  Within seconds of entering the dining room my stars were shining a full 5! JG by far has the best dining room I have ever been in. The placement of the tables, the colors, the dcor, it all gave me such an amazing sense of comfort, complacency and contentment. I know exactly which table I will request for my next visit.  The service was top notch. We had a party of three. Each course was brought out by three servers, all in perfect unison they removed the lids and cleared our plates when finished. The staff seemed to communicate through eye contact, they knew where to be and when for each other without saying a word.  The food was superb. What I loved about JG is that it is a restaurant for everyone. I have not eaten at Per Se or Eleven Madison because I prefer to have choices. My tastes are just not there yet. Like Le Bernardin JG gives three sections each with about 7-9 choices, one selection is made from each. Dessert is also included in the $119, a choice of 4 themes is given. When I say choices I mean just that. There truly is something for everyone. One is not limited to an \"only raw\" section etc. It Is not overly complicated, if you want liver and gibbys get liver and gibbys if you want chicken and shrimp they have that too. (liver=Foie Gras/Gibbys=Sweetbreads haha) One other thing I must mention is portion size. I have never nor did I ever think I would, leave with a \"doggy bag\" from any Michelin rated restaurant. The main course could have filled me by itself and the dessert was essentially 4 full sized desserts.  I felt under dressed in Khaki pants in the main dining room. I am recovering from a foot injury so I was really limited in my foot wear selection which in turn cramped my entire outfit (ladies I am sure you understand ha). Nougatine was a whole different story, I saw jeans and even a hoodie (dam Zuckerberg types) which I was not a fan of since the spaces are back to back and the main dining guests must carry though to go to the restrooms. Dress code for the main dining room is, no jeans, sweatshirts, sneakers and men are asked to wear a jacket. No children under 12 permitted as well.  The crowd was what I expected, you got your James Bond types, your Hillary Clinton types and your young up and coming couples spending an evening at JG for a special occasion.  I was overall very pleased with my dining experience at Jean Georges. Oh my goodness!!! The best (fancy) meal I've ever had! Jean George's is a 3 Michelin star rated restaurant, and it is truly head and shoulders above all other restaurants. Yelp really needs to have a 6th star that can only be used like once a year per yelper because my 6th star would go to JG! Service, ambiance, decor, music, timing, EVERYTHING was sweet perfection. These people run a tight ship at JG! Oh yeah, Barbara Walters sat next to our table like it was ain't no thang. Say what! Our servers didn't even flinch while bf and I were straight up gawking. It's very normal for rich and famous people to enjoy some JG! Lunch tasting menu was $130 for about 6 courses, but bf and I opted for the ala carte lunch, which was still great at only $38 for 2 plates plus $19 for each additional plate. My duck confit was shaped like a biscotti and tasted like duck butter. That sounds so wrong but it tasted so right. It came with bacon jam! What?? Gimme more!  Beef tenderloin was beef butter. So wonderfully amazing! My boyfriend kept on taking pictures of his food, and I kept on nagging him to eat his $200 lunch, please!  Foie gras was seared and served like a deck of cards. I wanted to cry after each bite. It was just that amazing. I LOVE FOIS GRAS! My trio of fig desserts was also delightful. They make food into foam and mucous, and it's like crack. Amuse bouche left me wanting more. I couldn't get enough of anything here. The Chef created such innovative dishes that tasted even better than they looked! Truly impressed! Service was professional and courteous. Each plate was presented and explained very well. The staff made my boyfriend and me feel like we were the most important people in the room (even while Barbara Walters was seated next to us)! I've been trying to figure out exactly what was wrong with Jean-George's - why do I feel that it is not the five star experience others do. The room is beautiful, the food was fine, and the service was excellent . So, what was wrong? What's wrong is this. The meal just wasn't memorable. Nothing stood out. I have had the pleasure of dining in many of New York's finest restaurants and I remember them all. I can still taste the wonderful tastes and I can still smell the wonderful smells - but not from Jean-George's. Not one course is remembered - not one memory. So, nothing bad to say, but if you want a memory along with your meal, go elsewhere. My wonderful girlfriend and I had a sumptuous, delicious lunch at Jean-Georges today. The sea bass blew everything else out of the water: the depth of flavor, the buttery yet delicate ensemble of vegetables and broth, defies explanation. I wonder if it wasn't poison--akin to the poison of Eve's apple--for the innocence I lost in the aftermath of leaving this culinary paradise. I have to give Jean-Georges a bad review, even tho the food was good and the staff excellent. I had a meal on October 27th that cost me nearly $400 (for two). That night I came down with food poisoning and couldn't eat for a day.  I considered the food I had that day and realized that the culprit was likely the raw tuna or salmon \"ribbons\" I had, so I sent them a comment through their website, leaving my name, phone number, and email. I did not ask for anything but suggested they consider their preparation of this, actually delicious, dish.  I don't expect any reimbursement, because they cannot know if I'm lying, but I did expect some response, at least a simple \"We'll redouble our efforts in this area.\" Without that, I have to say, Avoid this place. The expense is great, and if something wrong is discovered after you pay they do not care. 2 of us walked there for 1st June Sunday lunch via Central Park from our WaldorfAstoriaTowers hotel on a glorious day. Had the strangest seats ever-somehow inserted into the walls where we sat side by side facing out so that we can see the entire proceedings of most tables! haha..Started w amuse bouche of trio of thinly sliced zucchini, potato soup and smoked salmon wrapped in bits of beet on a bed of soybeans. We then had the :- Nishiki risotto - w Peekytoe crab, nori and key lime which was my favourite dish of the day.  Foie gras - w braised strawberry, granola, balsamic+sorrel. My 1st time having foie gras w fruit - a different experience indeed.  Sauteed Veal Scallopine - topped w FlyingPig ham+mushrooms. As confirmed pre-ordering, the ham was a tad salty but not as salty as feared. Also tasted the veal on its own and it was quite delicious indeed.  Black seabass crusted in nuts+seeds in an aromatic spice broth + spring veg. This was my 3rd best dish after the risotto and foie gras ( esp. since foie gras is banned in California so it was only my 2nd one of 2014, 1st one was at JoelRubochon@Tokyo!). For desset, shared the caramel trio which were:- Caramelized pineapple drizzled w sweet+sour syrup+pink peppercorn +flowers on top - divine. Mango upside down cake garnished w tapioca - interesting. Coconut caramel sorbet w candied peanuts - divine. Post dessert, we were given a complimentary assorted choc platter (5 different types), strawberry+rose macarons AND vanilla bean marshmallow - all delicious. For drinks, had their cherry+yuzu soda which was so delicious and a must try! Didn't get any wine/cocktails as had partied until 5 am the night before! Service was good, loved the 2 ppl presentation serving each of us simultaneously since we had our \"strange/special seats! Extra star is for the decor and tall windows from which I could see the trees from the patio and the sunlight streaming in. Total bill was only $132 including tip!! Overall, nice! Wasn't completely obsessed...ambiance was kind of boring when you consider New York and all it has to offer! Not to mention the bar was set high after visiting other Jean Georges restaurants. This was no question a meal that turned into a marathon...you'd have to arrive a ravenous, hungry beast to endure this meal. All of which I was not! We opted for the prix fixe option that seriously challenged our stomach capacity. I had a mushroom soup that was absolutely to die for. Other than the soup, I'm not sure anything else stood out.  A decent experience, my boyfriend and I are glad we came...but I doubt we will be back! We arrived as a party of 4, right on time for an 8:30 reservation on Saturday, unfortunately our table wasn't ready. We were offered to wait at the bar until one was prepared, which we were more than happy to do. The JG Gin and Tonic is exceptional, and after waiting about half an hour a manager came over and comped our bar until a table was ready, stating that such a long wait for a table was not typical of the restaurant. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the wait for menus once you are seated is longer than you would expect. However, from that point on dinner and wine service was very prompt. We split the table, which is something they prefer you not to do, half of us ordering tastings and half ordering prix fixe, and although initially hesitant the server accommodated, with the admonishment that the prix fixe diners would not necessarily be eating at the same time as the tasting diners. The staff was fantastic, and the food is more that what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. I've been back twice since my initial experience! Let's get straight to the point. While JG boasts a near perfect track record, I wanted to like every dish. Some fell short of my expectations. It was nonetheless a very enjoyable experience, but I'd love to see some more risks and adventure in some of the dishes (especially in the seasonal menu). Ambiance: A+ Only the best. Service: A+ Only the best. Timing was spot on, wine knowledge was boastful. SUMMER TASTING MENU: Softly Poached Egg, Caviar, Yogurt and Herbs: A+ This is one of his signature dishes. Incredible texture on the poached egg. Caviar was fresh. So much umami. Yogurt and herbs created a refreshing feel that cut through the umami of the caviar. Perfect. Tri-Star Strawberry and Feta Salad, Wasabi Sorbet and Micro Basil: A- Really innovative dish. Ended up liking it alot more than when I read the description. Obviously fresh ingredients, but the wasabi and strawberry worked really well. A tad too sweet, but it is on the summer menu for a reason. Peekytoe Crab and Squash Blossom Beignet, Market Cherry Tomatoes and Raspberry Vinaigrette: B Well done, but nothing incredibly memorable or innovative. Slowly Cooked Halibut, Summer Lettuce Puree, Herbal-Lime Vinaigrette: A+ Amazing texture and presentation on such a simple dish. A pleasure to eat; probably my favorite dish of the night. Roasted Maine Lobster with Market Corn, Smoked Chili-Almond Emulsion: B This was a bit disappointing. The chili-almond emulsion was a bit too thick in texture and the mole flavor was overpowering. The lobster was a tad overdone and became rubbery. Summer Pasture \"Lava Lake\" Lamb Rack, Tender Beans, Fresh Tomato Barbeque Sauce:  B- It saddened me to end my tasting with this dish. The lamb was cooked to a great mid rare, but the barbeque sauce tasted too original and safe. Lacked innovation for the price I paid. Stone Fruit Dessert Tasting: A+ Great variety and portion size: All were incredibly tasty. Perfect if you have a sweet tooth.  TRADITIONAL TASTING MENU: Egg Caviar: A+ Obviously a signature dish. Beautiful presentation and taste. Textures of the egg were perfect. Showcased the difficulty in creating a simple yet delicious dish.  Sea Scallops, Caramelized Cauliflower and Caper-Raisin Emulsion: B Scallops were in the emulsion for too long before served. The finish tasted like a braise instead of a sear because the edges got soggy. Scallop centers were delicious. Young Garlic Soup with Thyme and Sauted Frog Legs: A+ Terrific flavors, refreshing, and innovative.  Turbot with Chteau Chalon Sauce: B Interesting choice of sauce with the turbot. Very buttery and rich. Very traditional French. A bit too safe for me. Hoped to see more adventurous flavors with something as flat as the turbot. Lobster Tartine, Lemongrass and Fenugreek Broth, Pea Shoots: A+ Amazing texture on the lobster. Broth was absolute perfection in every way. Seasoning and presentation was perfect. Broiled Squab, Onion Compote, Corn Pancake with Foie Gras: A+ Amazing texture on the squab. Not dry whatsoever. A slight hint of gaminess. A very home-cooked feeling from the onion compote, and even more comfort food feel from the corn pancake. Foie gras was the highlight of the dish and offset the 'basicness' of the squab nicely. Chocolate Dessert Tasting: A If you are a chocolate lover, you are in heaven. Came here for lunch since they have an awesome deal; $38 for 2 dishes. The restaurant itself is pretty small, but i love their decor. Very modern and chic. The service was very attentive and the food was yummy! Nougatine is the bar/casual area of jean georges. Every single time, always leaving impressed. Black bass, butternut soup, veal, mushroom risotto Close but not quite worth the visit. The dining room was elegant and the staff very attentive and competent. The meal was wonderful until the main course. I had the Crusted Chicken. There was one flavor in this dish and it was salt. I didn't even bother eating it and the staff didn't bother asking why. I mentioned the saltiness to my wife who had the Hake and she said hers was salty also though she enjoyed it. The other negative is that we were seated next to the wait station. Simply the best dining experience and the best restaurant in NYC. Fine dining that is worth the price tag and is not overrated. The peekytoe crab dumplings, arctic char, and chocolate dessert tasting were the favorites of the night. But really, everything was phenomenal. After leaving, I made another reservation here as soon as possible and had the same exceptional experience. Came here with two friends who were visiting from San Francisco on a Friday afternoon for lunch. We were here mainly for the foie gras since CA has ban it. We had the two course lunch for $38/person which I think is a very good deal.  The foie gras brle did not disappoint us at all, it was so delicious, creamy and rich. The caramelized sugar added little sweetness to it, great combination. I feel like going back for more now as I am writing this :p Other food are great too, especially the crispy suckling pig with bacon. Excellent service, great atmosphere, glad that my guests were very satisfied with their meal. Definitely will go back again soon! What an experience coming here for lunch. The elegantly appointed dining room is bright, service impeccable. The lunch prix fixe is an experience that doesn't hit the wallet too hard, and I don't mind springing for a few extras.  Came here during the beginning of April, so I think I experienced their spring menu. The amuse bouche was awesome - the sip of soup with chili foam was a great start. I got the uni toast as a starter - the yuzu really highlighted the taste of the uni.  Chateaubriand on top of a korean bean paste-gojujang was super flavorful. Dessert bites with the house made marshmallows ended the experience. I can't wait to go again. This place is simply beautiful. The food is all delicious and the service is great.  I love the atmosphere, the light coming through the huge windows and reflecting inside, the servers all coordinated almost dancing together whenever they bring a new dish to the table.  I was there both for lunch and for dinner. At lunch time is more mellow, but the food is still impeccable, dinner is magic there.  I like that for wine you can have the taste (half glass) instead that the entire glass, which allows people like me, to taste more kinds without overdoing. I've been meaning to write this review for several months. We came out to New York on vacation in late April. We have been to two-star Michelin restaurants, but never a three. When we saw that Jean-Georges offered a two-plate lunch for $48, we decided to go for it. Of course, it's a fancy formal place, but I didn't need to wear coat and tie as for dinner (no jeans and sneakers allowed in formal dining area during lunch though).  Service was beyond impeccable as you might expect. So now to the food. The first dish I ordered was the Diver Scallops with carmelized cauliflower, etc. While very good, I thought that I've had equally good at other highly rated restaurants. We also had a nice sea trout amuse-bouche. Then came the second course - Black Sea Bass Crusted with Nuts/Seeds in a Sweet and Sour Jus (also had variety of mushrooms, pearl onions, and fingerling potatoes). I thought, OMG this is why this restaurant has three Michelin stars! I was without a doubt the single best tasting dish I have ever had in my life (I'm 62). Hard to describe how good it was, but there was magic in that Jus! BTW, my wife's food was also very good, but we can't remember the dishes exactly. Anyway, so glad we went, it was awesome! I had the salmon eggs Benedict, my husband had pancakes( w/ the fruit on the side) scrambles eggs and bacon.  Excellent food! A little spendy but well worth it. Service was ok. Went here for an anniversary lunch and this place is now our number 2 favorite restaurant in New York. The food was really excellent, especially the tuna yellowfin ribbons. Highly recommend the 2 course lunch for $38 plus the dessert sampler for $12. Would definitely come again for a special occasion. This place is well-worth its three stars, enough said in the photos. I LOVE IT. By the way, I was there in 2012 and I still remember the frog leg garlic soup's taste. I went to try their lunch pre-fixe menu since I am unwilling to shell out the big bucks for their dinner. I figured a $38 2-entree pre-fixe lunch is a reasonable price to pay for such highly renowned food.  In short, the experience was excellent. The food is delicious and service impeccable. I was amazed at how the waitstaff made clearing our tables a dance - one simultaneous flourish and our dishes are whisked away. It is well worth it for under $40, as I was satisfied, but not overly stuffed.  However, one gripe I had was their failure to mention sparkling water was not complementary. They approached our table when we were seated with an open bottle of sparkling water, and offered to pour out a glass for us. My boyfriend refused, so they offered him flat water (with no option of tap water). At the end of our bill, we unpleasantly discovered we were charged $40 for water alone. This certainly put a damper on an otherwise delightful lunch. Did not live up to the hype and the mister and I got two different prix fixes in order to experience the full breadth the restaurant had to offer. Service was impeccable, but the thing that is most important --- the food --- was mediocre. Nothing extra-exciting/special and the wine tastings were highly disappointing. There are other places in the city who do French fine dining and do it better and for less. Absolutely fantastic! The lamb rack is the single best meat dish I've ever had. It made me do the food critic's snap-to-childhood scene from Ratatouille. The dessert is a little too complicated but when it tastes spectacular, who cares if there's a lot of steps? Well, I had a lot of expectation for this place, but it seemed that, at least for lunch, it became a tourist spot. Even though I was a tourist too, I inquired them about the proper dress code and corresponded to it when we showed up only to see a lot of customers were barely business casual. I mean, if it were going that way, maybe they should just drop down their dress code and/or the price of lunch dishes. Anyway, we had 2 course/38 dollar lunch. My SIL had zucchini noodle which wasn't cooked well. I don't remember what my appetizer was, but it was alright (didn't have any issues with it). Our entrees were fish course, which was good even though it was a little salty. To me, this experience was definitely comparable to my experience at Perry St., which was great anyway. Still I award 4 stars because we just had 2-course lunch, and in a lot of restaurants lunch menus are not as good as what their reputation says. Overall, it was a good lunch, but a little disappointing with Jean George's name. This is my first dining experience at Jean-Georges. Here are my impressions. Ambience: The restaurant has beautifully subdued lighting without being too dark. The layout and furnishing are comfortable, and the noise control is pretty good. The dining rooms are lovely, warm and allow ease of movement. Staff/service:  The staff was incredibly polished and professional. At times, perhaps I wish they would display more warmth. The sommelier I found very pleasant and added more of a personal touch to his service. They were attentive without being too overbearing and but not too distant that it was hard to get their attention. It was definitely a good service experience.  Food:  This is where I found the experience to be lacking, surprisingly. We ordered the Winter tasting menu and was ready to be wowed. Unfortunately, we found most of the dishes just mediocre in flavor balance and texture, as well as some courses that had very strange pairings. The menu is described as having an Asian influence, however, I can only name one dish where I felt this to be true (the lobster course with noodles), which sort of played out like a glorified seafood ramen, except a good bowl of ramen is so much more satisfying and delicious. I also found the lobster to be a bit tough and chewy. I've definitely had better prepared lobster. The meal started out with a strange little appetizer platter which consisted of a mushroom infused with vinegar, gingery parsnip soup and sushi fish. The best thing on the plate was the intensely flavored mushroom. The parsnip soup wasn't that great but worked if you ate it with bites of mushroom. The fish also was nothing to write home about. We thought the platter to be a little odd. Most of the dishes we found to be very northern/eastern European in flavor. Certainly, the caviar dish with creamy micro potatoes was much more reminiscent of something Scandinavian. While the size of the micro potatoes was a novelty, they were really rather bland and mixed in with tapioca starch balls. The whole thing seemed to be mixed in a potato \"broth\" (one of the potatoes was actually not fully cooked through). Perhaps this was done to balance the saltiness of the caviar, but the flavors were really nothing special. I can't say much about the bay scallop tartare. It was that memorable. I remembered being okay with it, but definitely not blown away. I guess it was good, but not 5-star good. The ten mushroom soup really surprised me, because I was expecting something really special. It was a variety of individually prepared mushrooms. Unfortunately, the broth, while tasty, interfered with the enjoyment of each mushroom. I liked the tiny kick of chili in it. My husband who knows a lot about mushrooms was severely disappointed in this dish and went as far as to say he felt some of the mushrooms (which he recognized to be Eastern Europe) were imported marinated in a jar. The black sea bass was a huge disappointment. The fish itself was well-prepared, but the mistake was allowing them to pour this gingery cinnamon broth onto the dish. It was probably one of the worst pairing of flavors. The broth overwhelmed everything on the plate and made us feel like we were eating apple cinnamon fish. It was not good. The apple jus was so subtle in flavor it did nothing for me. The brussel sprouts were the best thing on the plate. We already discussed the lobster dish. The spice encrusted venison was yet another let down. While the meat appeared to be seared rare impeccably, it was incredibly tough (I've had venison many times before and never had any so tough before! Not what you expect from a Michelin-rated joint). I felt like I was chewing leather. The cabbage was good but run-of-the-mill and the chestnut puree was by far the most interesting item on the plate, which I enjoyed. A dessert palate-cleanser of sorts was brought--a tray of sorbet bites. I tried the cranberry (which was good) and the passion-fruit (which was insane). The passion-fruit sorbet was balanced with nothing. It is a fruit that needs balance with either cream, chocolate, custard or another fruit because of its intense tartness. They gave it pretty much straight-up with little to no sugar! Our faces puckered up right away and we cringed. Actually, my mouth hurt badly after that. Not what I call a palate cleanser, more like a palate destroyer.  The dessert plate was pleasant, with macarons and chocolates. I enjoyed the marshmallows they came around with.  Over all, we were expecting to be blown away, and it was quite the opposite--disappointment. I am sure they worked hard and masterfully, but in the end the flavors were really nothing special. I didn't even think the quality of ingredients was so great. I don't know if it's because we have pretty high standards and have a lot of food knowledge and cooking experience, but it was a big letdown. Oh my goodness! What a wonderful way to start the summer and celebrate an anniversary... From tops to tails, this was one of the finest meals that my wife and I have ever enjoyed. I started with a delicious Manhattan ('cause, well, when in Rome...), and then enjoyed sharing several amazing, well-executed dishes with my wife. We loved the Nishiki risotto with peekytoe crab, the salt and pepper sweetbreads, crispy confit of suckling pig, and the black bass crusted with nuts and seeds in a delicious sweet and sour jous. We finished off our meal with a tasting selection of chocolates, a port wine, and a double espresso. Heavenly! Jeez-Louise, the service was on point! We were seated at one of those private nooks and could see all the nonverbal cues the waitstaff would give to operate together so seamlessly. So cool! For $128 a pop, the Prix Fixe menu will have you stuffed beyond stuffed.  To start, we had the Yellowfin Tuna and that really tickles your taste buds! The foie gras is a must try. Who would ever think foie gras with strawberry granola and balsamic could be so mind blowing?! Next we had the seared salmon in miso and the crackling shrimp- both were incredible but I wasn't head-over-heels for the salmon. I loved the miso broth it was drenched in though! For our main course, we had the beef tenderloin and the sea bass crusted with nuts. The beef was great but not the mouth-watering Peter Lugers meat you have dreams about. The crusted sea bass, however, was pretty much the BOMB!!! It was in this yummy mushroom, ratatouille broth that was SUPER amazing.  By the time we hit dessert, my tummy was about to explode but wow, choose the Chocolate Tasting Menu!! You won't be disappointed. We also had the Summer Dessert Tasting menu but there was one option in that tasting that tasted like strawberry jam from Traders Joes so don't pick that! Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience but the bill was a bit insane- approaching $400 with a glass of wine, sparkling water, coffee with dessert, and a supplement for one of the entree option. Yikes! Very very good. Jean-Georges is definitely an easier reservation to get if you are using OpenTable, can usually find same day reservations. That's what I did and so we went after a day of shopping in SoHo and took the ride up to the Trump Hotel where this 3 Michelin Star Restaurant in located. You walk into its entrance and are immediately greeted by a large host desk where they guide you past the bar and more casual dining restaurant into its back lavish and more quiet room. We were given the option of having a more asian inspired tasting menu or the more transitional chef's tasting. Because of my absolute hatred for Jean-Geroges's restaurant in Meatpacking with asian inspired ingredients, I opted for the traditional tasting which I didn't regret. Very filing dinner with every flavor being extremely well done. The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly, even though we ended up being the last ones at the restaurant. They have awesome desserts at the very end too! Highly recommend if you are on a 3 Michelin Star tour. Will be back! I have to say I was shocked when I heard about their B rating AFTER I had a fabulous lunch there. We did not have a reservation but were easily accommodated. We came with my friends twins in a huge stroller and the staff went out of their way to open the side elevator for us to bring up the babies. The service was EXCELLENT and the outside area is to die for. You forget you are in the middle of Columbus Circle next to the subway. I did not even know this outside patio existed and I work down the street! Very lovely experience. We had the chicken and salmon both cooked to perfection. My friend is OBSESSED with the fries there, very crunchy and yummy. This place was amazing. I came here for lunch and the servers were really professional and knew exactly what to recommend. I loved the non-intrusive nature of the service as they paid attention to the nonverbal cues and refilled drinks without needing to be asked. So much thought goes into the dishes of which their current theme was that of the flavor of Spring and I did taste the freshness of spring. I had the Nishiki Risotto (loved every bite) and the Caramelized Beef Tenderloin(very good too but the risotto blew me away in the first course). I think the best part of the visit was when we ordered dessert. They carted out like 6 extra dessert plates that we had not ordered. I was in heaven...as far as a foodie/sweet tooth maniac like me was concerned. Definitely a great place to take a special someone or for a special occasion. Would definitely love to come back again. The restaurant setting is very nice, especially for lunch---clean and white with high ceilings and windows overlooking Central Park. Though the lunch prix fixe was very reasonably priced, I did not experience the impeccable food and service that everyone raves about. Everything was well cooked, but no dish carried me away to a far away fantasy land of ecstasy like in the Disney movie Ratatouille when the rat combined the flavors of a cheese and a grape in one bite to create a new flavor it had never experienced before.  Every dish was executed well technically, and I particularly enjoyed the crab risotto. However, nothing else really stood out as to make me acknowledge this is why the restaurant deserves 3 michelin stars. More baffling was the service.  Most of the staff was nice, but I found our main server more smug than helpful and the less-than exemplary service is why this restaurant is only A-OK in my book. I was served the wrong appetizer (a raw scallop dish instead of the cooked one I had ordered). I tried to eat it because I felt guilty having the server bring me another dish to replace the dish that I had mistakenly taken a bite out of, but it did not taste so heavenly or even enjoyable enough for me to decide to just keep it. After picking at it unappetizingly, I finally told the server I had ordered the other scallops and though she did not give me a hard time and quickly replaced it, she never apologized either.  Instead, I found the already questionable service go drastically downhill after. Unlike the other 3 michelin star restaurant we had gone to earlier that week where every course was impeccably timed, we waited much longer than just average for our next courses. I would have been very disappointed had this been the only 3 michelin restaurant I had gone to that trip, or if I had gone there to celebrate a special occasion. The only reason I would go back is because the restaurant ambiance is clean and elegant, and the lunch is reasonably priced for good quality food. However, I would not come expecting stellar service nor outstanding taste. Perhaps this experience was a fluke, but such a fluke should not occur in a 3 michelin star rated restaurant. Without knowing its reputation, I would never have suspected it to have even 1 michelin star.  Do try this place, but lower your expectations as to not be too disappointed. The $38 prix fixe does not include dessert, though you will get a few sweet treats anyway. The fresh fruit sodas are quite refreshing and not outrageously priced. Second time getting the lunch here, and it was wonderful. The madai sashimi was a medley of flavors that tasted like spring and the taste of the fish was not overpowered by the additional ingredients but rather enhanced by them. The foie gras brule was again and will always be a winner, for me it defines the word delicious and causes eyes to flutter and roll backwards with each bite. For the main course we definitely enjoyed the crispy confit of suckling pig, so flavorful and perfect texture and crisp. However this rating lost a star because of a disappointing experience with the caramelized beef tenderloin with pickled ramp fondue - not only was the pickle sauce completely overpowering, unnecessary and not enjoyable, but there was actually a piece of the meat that was so tough that I could not chew it and had to spit it out (understandable elsewhere but not what I expect at a 3 michelin star restaurant). Unless you love the idea of your beef tenderloin drenched in sour pickle sauce, please do not order this dish, or perhaps ask for the sauce on the side. Also, our table was not ready, so I went to use the restroom. Our table then became ready, but my husband told the staff he wanted to wait for me. I came out in a couple of minutes and our table had apparently been given away to another party, as we had to wait 20 minutes for another table to open up. If the staff intended to give away their table if we did not take it immediately, they should have informed my husband of this and he would have sat down and waited for me there instead. Love this place. Good for hanging out with friends. Cozy, good food. I am so coming back! Excellent food and view...service impeccable! Definitely in the top 5 of NYC. Definitely quality restaurant and worth the try. My issue is that I have had it almost on daily basis as I had been staying in the Trump Tower. Food 5 star, service 5 Star. Absolutely fantastic! The service is the BEST Ive ever experienced in NYC, and the overall experience made for one of the best meals of my life. My favorite dish was the toasted egg yolk in caviar, definitely worth the $40 supplement! $38 for a 2 courses lunch at a 3 Michelin stars restaurant.  Can't beat this! Will be back again :) I have gone to Nougatine before and I didn't realize they had a different menu. I know, it was when I was young and naive. I don't remember really being impressed with Nougatine and so I was never in a hurry to rush to Jean George, but after K rave to me about the birthday dinner there. I thought I should give this place a try and so I came here with Z. We had the following: Amuse Bouche - A delightful trio of a soup, a salmon filled eggroll like and this other thing. All were so delicious and I don't usually enjoy cooked salmon, but I love their take on the eggroll. Santa Barbara Sea Urchin Black Bread, Jalapeo and Yuzu: Really good and just so heavenly Nishiki Risotto with Peekytoe Crab, Nori and Key Lime: This might have been one of my most favourite risotto ever and I wanted more of this and I said to myself, I wish I could make this dish at home.  Artic Char Black Winter Truffle Crumbs, Crispy Parsnips: When Z got this dish, I was a bit disappointed, since i wanted this dish, but I don't want to get the same dish as Z, but I am glad I didn't. This was okay, but I preferred my fish more. Seared Hake with Spiced Jade Emulsion and Tender Celeriac: This fish was cooked perfectly and I loved everything about this dish.  Moving on to desserts, I am not a big chocolate or Caramel person, but the Winter dessert didn't sound appealing and the citrus I felt might be a throw away dessert. Caramel sound more interesting, but I really didn't want to get Chocolate, but Z said other desserts would not pair well with the Caramel and so we got the Chocolate. Chocolate White Chocolate Ice Cream, Yuzu Sorbet Milk Chocolate Custard, Mango Gel, Smoked Salt Meringue, Candied Orange Bitter Sweet Chocolate Tart, Fudge, Red Wine Sorbet Warm Chocolate Cake, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream Caramel Caramelized Pineapple Sorbet, Passion Fruit, Brioche Crme Caramel, Maple, Bacon and Pecan Powder Caramel Apple Confit, Graham Crumble and Crme Fraiche Peanut Torte, Caramel Mousse, Brown Butter Caramel I want to say I ate every single bit of these two desserts, everything was delicious. I usually don't care for molten like cakes, but their version was much lighter and not heavy at all. I really did enjoy all of their desserts. Service was great too and we got a prime table - a total fan. I came here with my wife to celebrate our 25th anniversary, we ordered their tasting menu, the starters were really good, the steamed fish were under cooked, the filet we too dry and over cooked in the outside. I most impressive were the service, very memorable. Make no mistake about it, all things considered, Jean Georges is an excellent restaurant. However, for a 3-starred restaurant it leaves MUCH to be desired. Every 3-starred experience I've ever had left me mesmerized and yearning to return. However, Jean Georges left me feeling ripped-off and angry. I will start with the positives. The dining room is one of the most beautiful in which I've eaten. Two of the 5 dishes (including amuses) were excellent, and one was one of the best dishes I've ever eaten (this was the strawberry foie gras). However, this is where the compliments end. My biggest gripe concerns service. When you eat at Daniel or Eleven Madison, for example, not only is the service run like a fine-tuned machine, but the staff does everything they can possibly do to make you feel like a guest of honor. This could not have been further from my experience at JG. Yes, the service was run well (there were some flaws). But, more importantly, the staff could be downright rude. There were many examples of this, but I will only go into detail on one.  A staff member (who earlier put us off with his aggressive behavior while serving us from the bread basket), brought us over petit fours. When I asked for clarification on what one of the item was (pate de fruit), he snarled \"I am trying to tell you, if you let me finish.\"  That is just one example of the service we encountered, but again, I will spare you the rest. I\"m sure this sounds like I'm nitpicking, but when you are paying anywhere from $500 to $,1000 for dinner, you expect to be treated well. And again, I've been treated extremely well with every other 3-starred dinner I've ever had, especially my multiple evenings at Daniel and Eleven Madison.  Now, on to the food. It was good, but nothing was world-class, with the exeption of the aforementioned foie gras dish. Both my entree and that of my wife's were way overcooked. We took the chef's recommendation, which was medium-rare, and both our dishes (I had the lamb, she had the filet) were medium-well).  There are many other restaurants in this city serving much more refined, creative fare. And they do it with better service. I left the restaurant feeling I had just been taken advantage of, something that should never happen at a 3-starred establishment. While the food at Jean Georges is obviously incredible, it's the service that really sets this restaurant apart. The waitstaff are so coordinated and fluid that they almost seem choreographed. Our waitress explained the tasting menu as someone who had not just memorized it, but someone who actually experienced it. Every person at Jean Georges seems to care about each and every customers experience. One of the dishes in the tasting menu featured caviar, which I am not the biggest fan of, and our waitress noticed that I hadn't eaten all of mine and asked if she could bring me something else. Even though I said no, I appreciated the gesture. If you want to go to a top restaurant in NYC but don't want the snobby attitude we've all come to expect from expensive places then make a reservation at Jean Georges. Prepare to be respected. Had our 7th wedding anniversary dinner here. Couldn't have asked for a better place to do so either. The hosts out front were very welcoming and warm. Service in the main dining room was personable and impeccable.  We both decided on the classic 7 course JG tasting menu this time. This menu has not changed since the inception of this restaurant so we knew what was to come but still we love that each dish every time we've had them are always consistent flavor and seasoning wise.   Started with an amuse bouche of a broccoli puree soup with creme fraiche, braised market seasonal greens with a wasabi kick, and a skewered tempura celeriac. All delicious and light. My top 3/7 dishes of the evening (because there are enough people on here who've spoken about each dish in length): I love the infamous egg caviar, I could probably have a dozen of these little babies if I was given the choice: lightly scrambled egg in its shell topped with vodka infused cream and american sturgeon caviar...again a perfect balance of flavors and textures. The young garlic soup with a side of crispy fried moist frogs legs was another standout dish for me. Lobster was sweet and went very well with the fenugreek broth. Dessert was a tasting on it's own. 4 different styles of chocolate represented. Then when you think you had enough they bring out a small dish of mini macaroons, more chocolates and their homemade marshmallow. And because we were here to celebrate, they also brought us a silky chocolate mousse cake with a cookie center topped with a beautiful gold foil laden chocolate ribbon. Begining to end I wouldn't have changed a thing, can't wait to get back here again. Snooty affair. Excellent food at an exorbitant price. Go once, so u can claim it. Floor to Ceiling windows overlooking Central Park can't be wrong. Leave your Jacket on, I was told sternly. Lamb i ordered was insipid, foie gras exquisite, dessert to die for. Let down on the main courses. Once a must, try out & decide yourself. Do carry an extra wallet, unless its a company dinner. There were several failures.  The herb yogurt soup compliments of the chef was too salty. The salmon tartare/sashimi was too warm (makes me nervous).  The American white sturgeon caviar didn't taste fresh.  I bit into something hard in the sea scallops. I pulled out something white and hard. Hope it's a part of the shell and not a part of my teeth.  The frog legs were done perfectly. They spilled much of my Mckenzie Rye manhattan when pulling my table out to ease my return to the table but didn't offer me another drink (I haven't even taken a sip yet). My wife's lamb was overdone (came out medium instead of medium rare as recommended by the chef). She didn't complain because it's how she likes it anyway. The table next to ours got it rare instead of medium rare. When their dish came back from the kitchen, it was overdone. They gave up on the dish and didn't complain further.  Probably the biggest failure was on my part. I didn't complain to the staff about any of it. On a positive note, the wine pairings were spot on. Andrea the sommelier was awesome. Have done the tasting menu many times here. Last time was when we finished with an opera. It's always impeccable service and the food is really great. Maybe it's had a few years where the food quality has dropped a little, but it still remains an amazing restaurant. I like to take people here when it is one of their first times doing a tasting menu, because I find it has a lot of bells and whistles and makes people feel very special. Wow. If you're looking for the ultimate fine dining New York experience, then look no further. I have eaten at both that the casual dining (inside and outside) and the main formal dining area. Everything is fantastic. The waiters have been taught the 'art' of presenting meals and it is very much appreciated! Every single ingredient is fresh and well thought out. The most memorable 'food' moment for me was the roasted beet and goats cheese parfait in the main dining. Delicious :) The cocktails are perfect too. Can't wait to go back! Loved my dining experience here. Food was inspiring. Atmosphere was very elegant. Service was perfect to every detail. Sadly I'm giving one of my favorite restaurants in NYC a three star instead of the normal five. I love this restaurant but it was just \"off\" this visit. We waited over an hour for our food and management said they'd comp dessert. We had the prefixed meal so this didn't help. They didn't seem to care very much. We asked our server over and over to bring the manager but they never came. We sat in bar area for first time so the experience wasn't as fabulous as all the other times I've gone. Still ahi tartare was amazing and beautiful. Although Jean-Georges definitely seems like one of the more accessible high-end restaurants in the city, particularly given its lunch availability, I'd never made it here in my nearly 6 years (to date) as a resident - so it was cool that my fiancee booked a belated birthday dinner here for me. I really dig the atmosphere of the main dining room, which has a relatively casual feel...perhaps part of it was the seating arrangement, where we both sat on the cushioned side facing outwards, but it definitely had the feel of a more social room where talking above regular conversation voice wasn't frowned upon. Of the service at the high-end ones, the waiters here definitely are the best. In particular, the lady who took our order and let us know what we were eating knew all the dishes cold, but was also good at giving us suggestions for drinks and actually acknowledging our presence (something that a lot of high-end restaurants in NYC are kind of bad about). As for the food - I'll start backwards, mainly because the tasting menu desserts are phenomenal, and on balance, I'd say they were consistently more delicious and interesting than the main plate. Your 'seventh course' of dessert actually consists of 4 separate desserts, so don't eat too much bread (self-advice that I was admittedly poor about following). The seasonal desserts were really well-done; I like the candied butternut squash, which tasted very much like pumpkin, and particularly the poached pear covered in candied pistachios, which had a fruity taste but with the crunchiness of crumbled pistachio. I also enjoyed the pomegranate sorbet with red wine syrup, as it served to accentuate the intense flavor of the pomegranate. The regular tasting menu desserts are also very good, but a bit more on the traditional side. All are chocolate-themed, but my favorite was the yuzu ice cream with white chocolate shavings - a very nice combo of the fruity and the decadently sweet. The lava cake with vanilla ice cream was top-notch as well. The extra pieces of chocolate at the end were also delicious, particularly the Kit-Kat-inspired piece. For my birthday, there was also a piece of chocolate in the shape of a small gift box - replete with gold shavings on top - that was presented, but I was way too full to eat it then (it's in my fridge now for later consumption). By far, it was the most original / interesting birthday dessert I've seen. As for the rest of the food - it was very good, but there were inconsistencies. Some of the dishes were really well-done and things I'd come back again just to try. The toasted egg yolk sandwich with caviar was exquisitely done; the texture and flavor of the yolk was such that I thought there was cheese in the dish (there is not), and the salty bursts of caviar help offset what would otherwise be a really heavy first bite. The scallops were solid, if not spectacularly prepared, though I did enjoy the caper-raisin emulsion that added a unique flavor to the scallops. Of the main courses, the seasonal hamachi sashimi with the finest-shaved pecans I've ever had (it has the texture of really fine bread crumbs) and sherry vinaigrette to add that dash of acidic flavor was so well-executed. The frogs' legs were good, if a bit of a shame that you get 3 tiny legs; they do taste very good and meaty; the complementary young garlic soup with chive blossoms was a nice contrast, as the garlic wasn't as...well, 'garlicky' as it usually would be. The mozzarella ravioli with black truffle shavings was a miss, though - very plain, and while truffles have a very distinctive aroma and flavor, it was completely absent in every bite I took. Both fishes were prepared well, but I definitely liked the bass better - it was a bit fuller yet succulent, and it wasn't overwhelmed by the broth it was served with, as the turbot was at times. The lobster was good, but if somewhat unremarkable; the seasonal variety was poached and served with tapioca and passion fruit, giving it an interesting flavor - but one that masked the flavor of the lobster itself. The standard tasting menu served it as a tartine, which didn't work all that well - the bread added unnecessary breadth to the dish, where the broth on its own was fine. The broiled squab was cooked very well, with a nice gaminess to the meat. Unfortunately the venison (on the seasonal menu) was overspiced, obscuring most of the flavor of the meat and making it seem as though you were eating a generic steak. Additionally, the red cabbage didn't really pair well with it. While the food was delicious, the tasting menus were a bit inconsistent. On an overall basis, I would go with the seasonal menu, but in all - I felt like the main-course food wasn't as inspiring as the dessert, which may have been the best I've had. I would come back again, but overall, I feel it's a touch below its fellow 3-star Michelins in NYC. Very attentive staff all around, from the Maitre D to the servers. Really enjoyed the three course lunch tasting menu and understand the portions are meant to be small, but the scallops were were way too tiny.  The main room is beautiful and we would absolutely go back for dinner, although, the beauty of the room is exceptional during the day.  Can't wait to visit NY again for another dining experience at JG! I'm not even sure I can do Jean-Georges justice. My friend and I heard of the great Tastes of Spring $38 prix fixe lunch here and dutifully made our reservations a month ahead of time.  Rather than recounting each dish, I will simply note that everything was impeccable. Having never eaten at a restaurant so fancy and refined, I was worried that we would be judged or feel uncomfortable. Instead the entire meal passed seamlessly with our server dutifully taking care of us. For the meal itself, peruse my pictures. I will simply note that Jean-Georges was a perfect introduction to fine dining. Our complimentary amuse-bouche was inspired and nuanced. Our complimentary chocolates and marshmallow were delicious. Perhaps for a special occasion, I will be back. Had this place bookmarked forever and finally had the chance to dine here, hyping up my expectations. And I realized I shouldn't have. This place really deserves 3.5 stars, but in all honesty, it's overrated. Either that or French food just isn't my forte. I surely hope it's the former? -Decor and interior were superb. Very sleek and fancy without the stuffy elegance. -Our waiter was some character. He was this sleek polished guy with the LOWEST voice ever. I was just politely nodding to half the stuff he was saying because I couldn't bring myself to ask him to repeat it, for fear he'd take my head off. Well, I should've, because when I accidentally ordered two entrees instead of one entree and one appetizer BECAUSE HE EXPLAINED IT SO QUIETLY (it's the two courses for $38 we opted for) he gave me the most condescending look ever.  -They have good wine. They recommended this certain Riesling to go with our meal, and even though I'm not a fan of whites, it was perfect. Sweet and crisp to the perfect degree of dryness. -I ordered the foie gras with the granola bits, and my friend got the shrimp with peach puree, and I wish I got what he did. The foie gras was good, but it wasn't anything spectacular. The shrimp was fresh and went well with the peach puree dip though -We both got the crispy pork confit and the chocolate option for the dessert and while they were equally enjoyable, I wasn't blown away at all. As someone mentioned, for such a renowned chef with steep price tags, I expected more. To quote my friend exactly about the pork confit, \"I could get this shit in Flushing for a fraction of the price.\" Excuse our French. Overall, it was a pleasant experience, but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice in dining. The place lives up to its name and michelin stars.  Girlfriend and I enjoyed a beautiful lunch here on Sunday. We had the set menu and ordered the following:  Foie Gras paste - awesome dish, crispy layer on top, smooth foie gras in the middle, and bottomed with a soft bread-like pastry.  Sliced Tuna with Avacado and Sauce - not as good as the foie gras, but it was really refreshing and light type of appetizer. It was very good considered the ingredients. Wagu - Wagu is wagu, it was not bad, but yet not great.  Loved their house dessert, and the breads weren't so bad either. $200 for 2, including 2 glasses of wine. I thought it was worth it. This is deservedly a 5-star place. I went for the $38 2-plate lunch. Probably the best way to go.  Tuna - cut into strips and a pod choice  Scallops- these scallops were done so well they didn't need the mustard sauce that comes with, recommend Fois gras- an item that's never left the menu and tasted special and fresh with the strawberries, a recommend for an original dish Crusted bass- great texture and base that can be eaten with bread. A recommend.  For dessert I tried the rhubarb selection which was fun as I like the flavor but the marshmallows they make are the best. The service and presentation is of course perfect .  This is a strong recommend at least once for lunch when you start to feel NYC is just overhyped trendy restaurants that rehash the same items. This place is different and a good reminder New York is special. We came here last saturday for our anniversary dinner, and I don't think I could have made a better choice.  My wife and I had the Autumn tasting menu. I was lucky enough to switch in the egg caviar (how could i not taste the signature dish?) for the opening autumn course. To die for. People who say truffles shaved on top of things are the height of luxury clearly haven't had this dish. Following that, each course kept getting better and better. The mushroom tea course still haunts my dreams - it was so incredible I could go back and have 7 courses just of that.  Besides the food, the service was also excellent. Accommodating, helpful and not too stuffy, it was perfect. I'm already looking forward to my next visit. It pains me to not be able to give a better rating of this restaurant. The atmosphere is definitely very classy and sophisticated. Lovely dining area and the bar outside is great to. I was visiting with my parents and we decided on the Jean George signature tasting menu.  We were all a bit disappointed with the dishes. The amuse bouche, egg caviar and desserts were our favorites. The rest of the courses was fine but nothing special. The last course (squab) did not impress, we even left most of it. Our waiter was very attentive and asked us if she could bring us anything else but we declined.  The dessert is a tasting of different chocolate desserts which was very good. They also brought out their homemade marshmallows, chocolate pralines and a small bag of chocolate for me my mother and I to bring home.  We ordered coffee and tea and my father asked to see their selection of liquor. The drinks took forever to come out and my father had to ask for their liquor list three times. This should simply not be necessary at a three star restaurant. Our waiter did not charge for the coffee and tea.  The experience was not three stars, it was a nice dinner but nothing that we will remember. I hope we had the misfortune to visit the restaurant on an \"off\" night. Lunch prefix in a Michelin 3 stars restaurant? I should skip school and work more often! After spending a year raising money and winning grants for my school club, we decided to treat ourselves with the leftover money by having an e-board lunch. We were looking for an affordable prefix menu that appeases everyone's taste. We decided on Jean George and made the reservation for 4 well over a month in advance.  We arrived at 12:15 for reservation. They had a table set up ready for us and immediately greeted us with the menu. We were presented the choices of 2 courses Spring Tasting or the multi-courses Chef's Tasting. We spent a good 15 minutes debating what to order - so many choices for a prefix! I ended up ordering foie gras granola as starter and seabass as my main course. Another friend ordered soft shelf crab and cod. The other 2 ordered asparagus salad with the seabass and scallop with bacon pork tenderloin? Before our starters came, we were given complimentary amuse bouche which included a warm soup? a broccoli puree crumble? and rhubarb sushi - all very light and refreshing. 4 types of bread were constantly given throughout our meal. I didn't try the other 3 because I prefer nutty, chewy bread. So happy to stick to my good 10 slices of rye! The server didn't even ask me if I wanted third or fourth servings after seeing my clearing of the crumbs - he just dropped 3-4 slices at a time onto my bread plate and I happily nibbled away.  Our starters came shortly after and I couldn't be happier that I ordered my foie gras. The granola and dried sour cherries were perfect complimentary to the salty creaminess of the dish- i couldn't help but continue to smother layers and layers of foie gras onto my bread. I must have downed additional 5 slices of rye during this course. My 3 friends all loved their dishes. I had a bite of soft shelf crab and it was perfectly cooked and well seasoned! YUM. I continued to chow down more bread while we waited for our main courses. I'm such a sucker for all good carb -.-. I was actually really full by the time my sea bass came. But seriously, best choice ever. OMG the broth was beyond heavenly. The fish was so nicely cooked and the mushroom and cherry tomatoes added the perfect texture. I drank and soaked every drop of the broth with my bread. My 3 friends literally thought I licked my bowl. The cod had a more Asian taste to it - it was really yummy but my seabass kicked its butt in taste. I'm not a huge fan of bacon but my friend's dish was amazing too... still BASS BASS BASS (MUST GET).  After our 2 courses were over. We decided to go for desserts. 12 dollars for Michelin 3 stars dessert? hell ya! They had 4 options - Citrus, Chocolate, Caramel and Rhubarb. We got everything but Chocolate which worked out perfectly because we were given a complimentary chocolate mousse cake! I took a bite of each - the Rhubarb tart was my fav. We were also presented with petit 4 and house made marshmallow. Marshmallow is not the typical kind u get from the supermarket - never have I ever eaten a marshmallow so soft! We ate and ate .. and ate.. no matter how full we were.. we just happily continued on - there's always more room for party in the tummy.  The total came out to about 240 including tax and tip for 4 Spring Tastings + 3 additional desserts. Best lunch deal EVER - wish my fiance could have came along to share the experience. I guess we'll just have to come back! This is the pinnacle of dining experiences. Everything was perfect. Every detail was accounted for. I went there for the first time with my sister and we got there with the idea of a slightly rushed hour long lunch. Even trying to move fast, we were there for a solid 3 hours, so make sure you give yourself some time to really enjoy the full experience. I have to admit as a 3 Michelin stars restaurant, I was looking for more.  The food was great, but somehow I couldn't recall anything special. I could taste the freshness in ingredients of each dish I had ordered, however they didn't seem to compose together- which is a shame.  As for the environment, it's more of a bistro style then a restaurant- way too noisy for my personal experience/ taste. On the plus side, the waiter was super friendly and helpful. I have finally decided to share this true story from a few short years ago... After securing a hard to come by Saturday night reservation, we dined at Jean Georges. Everything was going perfect until we notice our principal course was taking exceeding long to arrive. We patiently waited and waited, until we realized something was very wrong. Of course when something like this happens waiters, wine stewards, and captains vanish quickly.  Our meals finally arrived almost an hour after the plates from our first course had been cleared. They admittedly \"somehow lost our meals\". We diplomatically made no complaints or cries about it, as they were quite embarrassed all on their own (Jean George himself was in the house). Despite their blunder, the meal was still amazing. The foods coming out of their kitchen rocked! Fast forward: A few days later, I am out of town on business and the phone rings in my hotel room. (How they tracked me down I do not know). A very senior member of their management team learned of their dreaded mistake during their staff meeting. He called to personally apologize and invited us back as his guest on the Saturday night of our choice. Think about that! We happily returned.  While common in other restaurants, a gaffe of this magnitude rarely occurs at Jean Georges. I can say nothing but good and would go back again and again (when my wallet permits, of course). I am vegan and gluten free. I had picked out this place for a special occasion (bf's birthday). Upon arriving at the restaurant, I was told by the server - the only vegan and gluten free entrees they could do is by replacing the fish dishes with tofu. I was surprised by this since I had specifically asked for vegan and gluten free options when i made the reservation on the phone, and I was told said they could easily accommodate for my dietary restrictions. When I'm going to a 3-star Michelin star restaurant, having a meal with a slab of tofu added as the entree is not really my preference. That being said I found the food perfectly seasoned with the balance of spice and citrus flavors. My boyfriend ordered the arctic char (which was a tad overcookrd but otherwise delicious) and the beef tenderloin (which was chewy and he wasn't a huge fan - with too many Brussels sprouts). I ordered the butternut squash soup and tofu with romanesco cauliflower - both of which I loved. Both our amuse bouche were amazing as well. My boyfriend ordered the chocolate dessert and they got me a pomegranate sorbet and a Riesling gelle with passion fruit - one word 'delicious' and super refreshing! They also bought out a chocolate cake shaped like a gift since it was my boyfriend's birthday (I had requested for this). While our experience was good - it was not exceptional as I was expecting. That was primarily due to our server who was neither friendly nor forthcoming with information regarding the food or the wine list, which as you can imagine can be a little frustrating! Phenomenal: food, service, wine pairings, atmosphere. It's all fantastic and what you should expect of a restaurant of this caliber. One of the best dining experiences I've had - only rivaled by eleven madison park. Blows per se out of the water. And definitely go for the white truffle supplement! Jean Georges experience was outstanding. It's all about creativity, excellence, attention to every detail. Highly recommended ! A must visit for every culinary adventurer ! Can't wait to go back again.  A big big plus and cheerios to the wait staff, very efficient and on top of their act ! One of the most amazing dining experiences I have had in my life. Everything from the service to the food was outstanding! I had the hamachi sashimi, risotto, and sea bass crusted with nuts and seeds; each dish was to die for! I finished with the chocolate dessert plate and felt like I was eating little pieces of Heaven. My boyfriend had the diver scallops, seared gulf shrimp with baby artichokes, and the sea bass as well, with a winter dessert which was also delightful! We were both extremely satisfied and full by the end of the meal! Also try one of their big apple cocktails! The vodka from Brooklyn had a smooth taste. Intriguing ambience undoubtedly... Who are these people dining in here. Chinese trinket millionaire? Pro athlete wives? Old school, jaded city dwellers (a good amount). Azn instagrammers. Expense account loopers (mostly). Food is like first class airplane food. Really. Neatly portioned, too small, and lukewarm. Sauces always added something but tasted dated and tame. Service was excellent especially the woman whose sole job was to open this one door (just keep it open?). Shout out to the bread guy too, he knew within 20 seconds that I was done with my slice of bread. Ps my dining companion loved every second of it. Lunch at Jean Georges was our final meal in New York after a long weekend full of fine dining; what a wonderful end to our vacation. Lunchtime at Jean Georges is a fantastic bargain - especially considering that this is a Michelin three star venue. For $38 there is a two course seasonal prix fixe with a myriad of options for each course (a handful incur an additional surcharge). For $19 you can add additional savory courses, but portions are surprisingly large - this is not a case of a low-ball price that you then have to tack on all sorts of extras to have a fulfilling meal. There is also a six course tasting menu available for $148, but we feel as though we received an authentic dining experience with the prix fixe.  Also included in the price is amuse bouche (today their was a trio of beautifully plated bites that were nearly the size of some appetizers I have had elsewhere and was a wonderful start to the meal; my favorite was pickled rhubarb atop sushi rice mimicking a piece of Nigri sushi). Bread service is also included; today there were four different offerings with the Ciabatta rolls being my favorite (and it seemed within moments of finishing my bread a server appeared offering more).  My peekytoe crab dumplings appetizer with a meyer lemon tea sauce were delicious as was my entree of veal scallopine coated with bacon (sinful, but amazing) and topped with mushrooms and lavender. My wife thought that her asparagus salad with hollandaise and truffle vinaigrette was possibly the best salad she had ever consumed and also raved about her American Wagyu beef tenderloin with potatoes, chili and shallots soaked in a lychee syrup ($15 supplement).  Following the savories there is the option of a cheese course; today they had four cheeses available and for $10 you could select two or $14 three. We went with the three course option and these were some serious good cheese! Dessert at Jean Georges is a lot of fun; they feature dessert tastings where several different miniature presentations are served surrounding a theme such as citrus, caramel or chocolate. I opted for the citrus tasting and loved this dish. As the savories were on the rich side this dessert was easy on the palate and had just the right amount of sweetness. My favorite component of this course was served inside a jar that had different layers of texture and flavor; on top was a snow made of Buddha's hand (was like a snow cone consistency), next were assorted candied slices of citrus and on the bottom was a gelee comprised from Riesling. Following dessert a tray with approximately ten different mignardises were served with some excellent bites (the grapefruit and rose macaroon, a miniature Kit Kat bar and a chocolate covered caramels were my favorites).  The dining room is elegant but comfortable; classic but not out of date. Large windows on both ends let in lots of natural light and afford views of Central Park. Some of the tables offer side-by-side seating on well cushioned benches to help set a romantic tone. We had an early reservation as we had a plane to catch back to Chicago but by 45 minutes into our meal the dining room was at capacity; tables are sufficiently spaced so that even when full there is tranquility. While jackets are required at dinner time, the dress code is slightly relaxed for lunch (no jacket required, but no jeans or tennis shoes permitted). To maintain the formal ambiance young children are not permitted, but there is a more casual sister venue next door (that even offers al fresco seating on the terrace during warm weather).  Service was outstanding; friendly, attentive, polished and personable. Modifications to a couple of courses were executed flawlessly and our primary server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu when I had a couple of inquiries. Pacing was neither rushed nor slow (our meal lasted approximately 90 minutes; the service is at such a high level that if you are in for a business lunch and need to be in and out sooner I imagine this would readily be accommodated). Portions were just right so that we left comfortably full (and gratefully did not have to indulge in any LaGuardia Airport food while waiting for our flight).  Lunch at Jean Georges is the perfect opportunity for somebody to partake in world class dining without paying much more than I have shelled out for some very mediocre meals at chain restaurants in the past. Even the beverages are extremely reasonable for fine dining; wines by the glass start at just $9, I saw some really cool looking cocktails served and they offer interesting homemade herbal sodas such as black cherry with yuzu. This was certainly one of the top lunches I have enjoyed anywhere and rivals dinners I have consumed at several Michelin starred venue. I definitely hope to return next time I visit New York. Although I didn't like Jean George cookbooks, when I tasted his cusine I became a convert, and came here every trip to NYC. Unfortunately the last lunch with my son and his girlfriend, after setting up their expectations as the one great place in NYC that is a must, the food didn't turn out that way.  Sea trout with sea trout eggs were just a mess in a bowl.  Deep fried sweetbreads had almost no flavor and was served on spicy sauce which overpowered whatever little taste there was. One of us had suckling pig confit and was one dimensional in taste and the texture was in part dry (like soup meat) or fatty. Another one ordered chicken and it was nothing special. The Jean George I came to displayed a keen sense of taste and texture in the cooking that is now sadly missing. Had a much more superior meal at Le Bernadin. * Obviously, this review is graded on my special scale for very high-end restaurants. Yes, it's better than, say, the last thing I rated 3 stars. When you charge this much money, you get my specially harsh grading scale.   To be honest, Jean-Georges is normally a 5 star destination for me. I love Jean-Georges. That's why I was so disappointed on a recent visit when we encountered several real clunkers in our prix fixe. I write to encourage you to avoid these dishes although these were so inexcusable that I wonder whether you should just go to Le Bernardin instead:  1. The \"Winter\" Dessert: This 4 part dessert tasting was singlehandedly ruined by the baffling \"Poached Pear, Passion Caramel, Rose Whipped Cream and Crushed Nuts.\" The pear is too big to eat without a knife, yet none is provided. The passion caramel is astringent and bitter, but in a bad rather than interesting way. What I presume to be the crushed nuts (which looked and tasted to me like toasted tapioca balls or israeli couscous, honestly, if I was asked to describe them), stuck to the pear by way of caramel, added no more to the dish than rice krispies would have. Impossible to eat and yet pointless once you succeed. This was just an all-around unpleasant dish completely unworthy of Jean-Georges.  2.  \"Sauteed Foie Gras, Green Apple Puree, Dashi Yuzu Foam\": So Jean-Georges's classic Foie Gras Brule is a work of genius, a round torchon topped with perfectly crunchy sugar, and set off with some kind of citrus gelee, depending on the season. Looks like dessert, but is actually just the perfect savory indulgence.   I assumed that sauteed foie gras would be as good; and the green apple puree and dashi foam were. However. My foie gras was burned. Seriously burned, such that the thinner end was dry and mealy. How does one make foie gras dry and mealy? And why is someone with such an awful hand with protein working at Jean-Georges? Plus, there was a blood line in my dish. I'm not a prep cook, but I thought you are supposed to clean those.  3. \"Sweetbread with glazed chestnut and black truffle vinaigrette\": Were this dish not covered in fragrant black truffle shavings, I would say it was a stolid, brown, too heavy waste of incredible sweetbreads. Also, the dish looked like a dog's breakfast, as my english friends would say.  4. I don't remember the full description of the fourth bad dish, but it was something like a snapper in broth. The problem was that the broth tasted like rendered butter tinged with yuzu(?) - an effect perhaps to be expected at Per Se, but not at Jean-Georges, whose broths generally tend towards the ethereal and light (compare this fat bomb to the Celeriac-Meyer Lemon Tea served with the Peeky Toe Crab Dumpling, which I think ought to be bottled and sold at bodegas everywhere). Just very off-putting.  More generally, I think the change in pastry chef from the electric (if annoying, personally; at least his television/media personality) Johnny Iuzzini to the new guy is very bad. Dessert have grown in size to the same extent that they have declined in deliciousness. The restaurant's tactic appears to be to overwhelm with quantity, but that is more what Chili's would do then a food temple of this apparent quality.  Service was very good. Jean Georges is rated as one of the best restaurants in New York City. With that said, I walked in with really, really high expectations. The drinks were great, but I felt the server pulled a few tricks of the table-waiting trade because my girlfriend unknowingly ordered a glass of wine priced at triple the one she picked. She asked for the rose, and the waiter nonchalantly asked \"sparkling or flat\" and without thinking, my lady responded with the former (which we discovered cost a third of the pre-fixe menu). On the other hand - Great Manhattans. The service: top notch. Definitely felt like 3 michelin stars. The food: We each had the three-course pre-fixe. The scallops were a bit of a downer as they were pounded too thin, but the raisin sauce was exquisite. However, the dish was not even in the top 5 scallop dishes i've had. The corn ravioli is incredible as are the lamb chops. The squab grows on you quickly. The dessert: the amount of dessert was disproportionate to the meal (I know, can't believe i'm complaining about too much dessert). The waiter did ask us prior to our meal if we were celebrating anything special (our anniversary) and they provided us with a complementary piece of cake (also delish, but sent the dessert course over the top). Presentation was impeccable and it was pure decadence, but the sheer amount made me forget about the courses prior. I'm big on coffee and man, it was awesome. Overall: It was a great experience and despite the dining room being populated, it felt very intimate. The attention to detail was inspiring. Would I come back here? Maybe for the lunch. The service, ambiance, presentation, value (at least at lunch) and overall meal experience are all deserving of 5 stars. And the foie gras appetizer deserves 10 stars. The rest of our food, though, was more like 3 stars. So overall, I'll only give it 4 stars even though it pains me a bit because we enjoyed our meal here so much. Lunch is 2-course prix fixe for $38. We started with a plate of three amuses ( ), beautifully presented. There was a broccoli-ginger soup with citrus foam, a pickled radish made to look like sushi, and a pea flan with carrot vineagrette. All were interesting but none of them were really to our tastes. For apps, I had the foie gras torchon with cherries, granola and balsamic vinegar ( ,  ) (no supplement!) Wow, it was the best foie gras dish I've ever had in my life. I haven't had foie since it was banned in CA last year and this was the perfect reintroduction. Even though the accompaniments (cherries, etc) were not especially to my tastes, they suited the rich, creamy foie perfectly. My husband had yellowtail tuna ribbons ( ) which he liked but thought was a little too spicy. He also had serious ordering envy over the foie. If you like foie at all, you must order it here. Our entrees were a bit of a disappointment.  I had the arctic char in a spiced jade emulsion ( ). The sauce was way too spicy for me and so I had to just take the fish out and eat it separately.  I was really unprepared for that level of spice in a French restaurant, especially without a warning about how spicy it was. The fish, while delicious (it was cooked medium rare not medium well as I requested but it tasted wonderful) was pretty boring on its own. To her credit, our waitress noticed me removing the fish from the sauce and asked if she could bring me another entree. I said that wasn't necessary but she insisted on at least bringing me more white asparagus since the ones in my dish were covered in the green sauce. I really appreciated the gesture (and give them major points for service) but the asparagus she brought out were so salty they were inedible. They tasted like they had been boiled in oceanwater. I realize they're not meant to be eaten separately from the sauce, but it didn't really do very much to redeem the dish.  My husband had a veal scallopine that he wasn't very impressed with either ( ). It came with ham, which he's not a big fan of, and he didn't realize the ham would be cooked into the veal, which he found overwhelmed the veal flavor. After the meal, they cut each person a vanilla bean marshmallow tableside ( ) and then bring out a tray ( ) with two kinds of chocolates, a raspberry macaron, some sort of jelly and a lavendar white chocolate cluster. I don't like marshmallows but I could tell this was a good one, it had a really nice vanilla bean flavor. The tray of sweets was pretty standard but the lavendar white chocolate cluster was unique and very tasty. We were celebrating my birthday and they brought out a complimentary birthday cake ( ), which was very thougtful of them. Overall, the experience of our meal from start to finish was perfect and the foie was unbelievable. The foie aside though, the rest of the food didn't blow us away. I think this is in large part because it didn't really align that well with our tastes. I would go back though, for the foie alone, and I'd be especially inclined to if they had dishes on the menu (it changes seasonally) that are more to our tastes.  Dress code: Officially the restaurant is jackets required, but it seems to be very relaxed at lunch. Most patrons (including us) were wearing what I think of as \"Sunday Best\" attire - bright dresses with cardigans and nice sandals for women, collared shirts and khakis or dress pants for men. There were a few people in jeans and a few couples where the guy was in a full suit and tie and the girl was in a tiny black cocktail dress and sky high stilletos; both groups were the exception and stood out. The food meets my every expectation, except they were better! I love love the tuna I had, which was perfect in every possible aspect: its artistic look, and flawless taste! I would eat like this everyday if I could; this place made my mouth extremely happy. Came here for a special occasion and the staff was definitely successful at making it special. I've never had a better chair push or escort to the bathroom. The service and food was wonderful - even the bar nuts, laced with molasses and cardamom, and cayenne (?). Everything was beautifully presented and almost perfectly spiced.  There were a few things I didn't care for, like the amuse-bouche and marshmallow dessert, which seemed pretentious. And the tuna ribbons were almost ruined by all the sauce poured on top. Also some people at the bar were rather rude and pretentious but the bartender more than made up for it. My wife and I had lunch with friends at J-G yesterday. We were disappointed. I had foie gras and sweet breads. She had butternut squash soup and hake. The foie gras was only \"good\" and the portion was miniscule. My sweetbreads were over-cooked, despite having asked the waiter to tell the chef to under-cook them. My wife especially enjoyed her soup but said the hake was nothing special. For dessert, I had the chocolate plate and she had the citrus plate. The only thing tasting of chocolate on my plate was a mini-lava cake. She enjoyed her dessert. Wait-staff were attentive but made a production out of the service of every course. After serving, the waiter would give a minute-long description of each person's food with instructions on how to eat it (\"the chef invites you to use your fingers,\" \"the chef invites you to squeeze the lime on your fish\"). Trs pretentious. Overall, the wait staff were helpful, the atmosphere pleasant and the food good but, for a restaurant that bills itself as four star and given the prices, it was not up to snuff. Jean-Georges is a great guy! Met him at Fire Island long ago and love this place!  Top of the line in NY NY. Enjoy! I like to sit outside too... :)  Best, Neal H. Hurwitz NY NY I loved the decoration of this place, beige and cosy. The service was professional and discret. We tried the jean georges menu which is fantastic (specially the cabiar egg, the fish and the scallops) but a bit too big for a dinner with 7 dishes. The soup with the frog legs was a bit too oily. They paid attention to any details and offered a cake with canddles for the anniversary of friends (we didn't ask for). 3 Michelin Stars and 5 full stars in my book. I had an incredible experience at Jean-Georges from beginning to end. I have eaten at both Nougatine and Jean-Georges and the classy environment of the Jean-Georges dining room cannot be beat  // LOCATION // 1st floor of the Trump Tower at Columbus Circle at the SW // SERVICE // We were 10 minutes late for our lunch and our table was not ready. The hostess apologized profusely and when we were seated only 5 minutes later, we were handed two flutes of champagne on the house. The service from beginning to end was impeccable with a formal presentation of each course // DRESS CODE // They do not enforce the jacket requirement for lunch anymore, but men should still wear a collared shirt and no jeans. Half of the male patrons at the restaurant were wearing full suits for lunch and it was a Saturday.  // FOOD //     + Amuse bouche: Carrot puree which was incredibly refreshing     + Tuna ribbons with sliced radishes, avocado mash, and soy ginger marinade: My favorite. The delicate cuts of tuna were wound into a beautiful display and the ginger marinade which was poured on by your server at the table complemented the fish wonderfully     + Hamachi with yuzu avocado sauce and shredded radish: The hamachi sashimi was so fresh. The yuzu made the avocado mixture very tart which I loved and the presentation was beautiful     + Fish on summer vegetables: The fish was buttery, fresh, and incredibly succulent    + Parmesan-crusted organic chicken with spinach: Loved the texture of the fish which was crunchy on one side and incredibly soft and tender on the other    + Complementary desserts: Vanilla bean marshmallows, assorted chocolates, and macarons with raspberry cream: I do not care much for marshmallows but it was fun to have them cut and served to you from a huge glass jar filled with sugar. The macarons were bite-sized, delicate, and had the perfect texture.  Our experience here was wonderful and I plan to come back to Jean-Georges every time I visit NYC  *tip: The 2 course lunch for $38 is so worth it and gives you a great chance to try Jean Georges at a more affordable price Place to be seen spot in Trump International. Good get on restaurant week. As wonderful as the food was, I need to start out by talking about how the service at this restaurant is the shining star. In a world where you are lucky if you can get your server to refill your empty glass, this place stands as the standard of what fine dining service is all about. Women are always addressed first, in order of matriarch. When food is served, the waiters put down and take away all plates in perfect unison. It's like watching synchronized swimming, only it's actually entertaining. Waiters never stack plates either. Each one only carries one plate per hand. These may not seem like big things, but if you have a party of 6 like I did, that means that you have 3-6 servers taking care of you at any given moment. It is exactly how my dad described his time as a waiter on the Queen Mary when it was still a functioning ship. Now, onto the food. What am I really going to say here that hasn't been said? We all know the food is spectacular. I could try to come up with some witty way of describing it, but what's the point. It was fucking amazing and I knew it would be. The real thing to talk about is LUNCH SPECIAL! $38 for a three course lunch at a three Michelin star restaurant? Now that's worth talking about! AND they gave us extra complimentary appetizers and desserts as well!  As if all that wasn't enough, I got to mean JG himself and take a picture with him. Best $38 meal of my life, that's for sure! It was my best experience in the restaurants in NYC.  I tried the tasting menu for dinner, expensive but definitely worth it. The dessert plate is so lovely. I have already booked another dinner for my family and another family. We will try out soon and hope the food is still good! Ok so maybe when you list under dietary restrictions, \"One of us is a vegetarian (pregnant) and the other is a pescatarian. No alcohol in preparations for either,\" you run the risk of pissing off the kitchen. But oddly, this would not be the first time we've made such requests of a restaurant of this caliber. Each other time we have, however, the restaurant has accommodated our request without batting an eyelash and produced an amazing meal regardless (e.g., L'espalier in Boston and Charleston in Baltimore).  Not so at Jean-Georges. Not only was our server rude about it (saying something like, \"Chef is willing to work around this challenge\" and at one point walking away abruptly after we asked a question about other options), but the food was not that great when it did come out. I've had better butternut squash soup at a food court and the lobster was kind of chewy. Our server warmed up a little as the night went on and actually managed to smile by the end, but I've never felt quite as dietarily unwelcome at a restaurant before as I felt at this place.  The service in general was a little off. Besides our main server, who must have been the victim of one yo mama joke too many from a pregnant vegetarian, the other wait staff would clear your plate literally while your fork was still mid-air and covered in butter.  The only redeeming thing about this place was the dessert quartet - which was easily 5 stars. The molten chocolate cake, quince layer cake, caramelized pineapple sorbet, and I forget the fourth yummy thing were phenomenal and complemented each other perfectly.  Bottom line, neither the service not the food (with the exception of the dessert) at this place was anything to write home about, and certainly not what you'd expect from one of the top rated restaurants in one of the top food cities in the world. Especially not if you're a vegetarian (pregnant or otherwise). One of the best French in NY. Cost is affordable for this quality and I highly recommend it. I will definitely come back!! Best dinning experience I had. Pricy but relax ambience for dinner. Worth every penny. We couldn't stop smiling through the entire 4 hours. Came in here for lunch, so jacket wasn't required when we went in. Food was excellent, but the dining room is a bit cramped- spent most of the meal listening to the women complaining next to me. Going to places like this it seems like no one is ever satisfied. overrated. overpriced. boring.  I may be in the minority, but I've had better food, service and experiences at other restaurants. Jean George is hands down my favorite restaurant food and service wise. It's genius! Both the seasonal and traditional tasting menus do not disappoint, although I much prefer the seasonal groupings in the summer as the flavors are lighter and brighter. It's not the most beautiful restaurant of the bunch- but you do not want to miss the food or experience if possible. Great place to have a luxurious lunch at a fairly decent price. The food is flawless and the environment is made perfect by the waiting staff. A three course lunch would only cost ~$60 and it is worth a visit. There are complimentary petit fours if you only decide to do a two course menu Again, the Food Network said this place had the best desserts and again they lied. I had the deconstructed chocolate dessert. It was nothing special. It came in three little parts. Each one wasn't memorable. Enough said. Their $128 pre-fixe menu is totally worth it and very reasonable for a three-Michelin stars restaurant. I really recommend fig and chocolate desserts. I was very impressed with their service and the experience as a whole. I have been coming here for lunch several times over the past three years, and I have to say, 2013 spring menu is truly amazing!  The amuse-bouche came with a little glass of vegetable soup, a sushi looking marinated radish thing, and a little pea pudding with some orange-color citrus sauce. All delicious.  I have Santa Barbara sea urchin and veal. Sea Urchin will blow your mind-really really good. Veal is kind of Chinese taste, which is quite good, but too salty for the flavor.  My friends had sea trout of oyster tartar. Unfortunately, they all think it's not just too salty but can't taste anything from the oyster. The regular tuna tartar is definitely better. We ordered three dessert plate. If you order \"chocolate\" under 60%, it comes with 4 samples, including a sponge-looking chocolate cake, a chocolate melting cake, a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on chocolate crunch, and another scoop of ice cream (cant remember the flavor). We also order \"Caramel\", this plate also comes with 4 different little things- a caramel pudding, four slices of caramel marinated banana, a very delicious caramel cake, and a scoop of caramel ice cream. These two dessert plates are AMAZING! Chocolate is always a good choice in Jean George, and it's caramel is just as good. We also tried \"citrus\". There's a little glass of of \"citrus salad\" which is a jelly kind of thing, it's really really good. But other parts of it, which including couple orange on ginger breads and couple drops of lemon creme brle, are just so-so.  at the end, the waitress brought over a plate of marshmallows and a plate of several dessert bites. These two are as good as usual.  After all, maybe because of the sea urchin, I am So much more impressed than any of my other dinning experience. Just for those three tiny bites!  And after all these food, we were so full that no once really had any desire for dinner that day. I hate to slam a restaurant, but my experience at Jean Georges was pretty appalling considering it's a 3 Michelin star restaurant and owned by a really famous chef. Keep in mind that my review is compared to the standard and expectation that a 3-star restaurant should be and the level of quality that the restaurant touts. My list of grievances: 1. Food was not great. We came on New Years Eve for the early seating, which featured the regular tasting menu instead of the special NYE tasting menu. I don't think there was one memorable dish of the evening for me. Everything was over sauced and condiment flavors were too strong. None of the natural flavors of the ingredients came out. From the lack of imagination and creativity of ingredients, to the richness of each dish starting with the first one, I was sorely disappointed for a $600 meal. We left stuffed, but not in a good way. I couldn't enjoy anything because my palette and appetite were clammed up with the heaviness of each dish. There was poor planning and execution mistakes all over the place. 2. $85 corkage... REALLY? Is that completely necessary? It really goes against the spirit of good food. 3. The service was not worthy of a 3-star rating. Our waiter had this haughty air about him. He wasn't entirely attentive but tried to make small talk with us. Not only was there lack of finesse in the latter, he really rubbed me the wrong way with his know-it-all attitude (even though he wasn't that knowledgeable). The bread guy was inconsistent. Sometimes he'd come by frequently and other times he didn't. At one point, he didn't even ask me for bread when he came by our table. 4. The wine. I ordered a glass of the Pinot Noir. When I tasted it, it was obvious that the bottle was open too long. Instead of offering to open another bottle, our waiter suggested another wine, which was twice the price. 5. Restaurant interior. We were seated in the dining room, which I thought was overly cramped, especially for those at a table for 2. The larger round tables were further apart from tables around it, but the 2-seaters are dangerously close to each other. If I'm shelling out hundreds of dollars for what supposedly is a good meal, I don't want to hear other people's conversations as if they're on speakerphone. The tables were also really small. At one point, I wondered how I should fit my water glass, wine glass, entree plate, and bread plate. For a restaurant that has received 3 stars from the Michelin guide consistently, the service and food were both seriously lacking in quality. I have been to 1-star rated restaurants that were far superior in food, service, and comfort level, which leads me to think that the Michelin rating of NY restaurants is hit or miss, when it should really be a reliable guide to fine dining. On our trip to NYC, we couldn't pass up the chance to have dinner at a 3-star Michelin restaurant. Out of the many Michelin starred restaurant, we decided on JG and made reservations a week in advance. Service was impeccable and exactly what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant. Our waiters were attentive and knowledgeable and our water glasses were always quickly refilled. We went with the Prix Fixe Menu which lasted 3 hours for 4-course dinner. It was more like a 6 course dinner with the 'on-the-house' small dishes that were also served.  I had the foie gras brulee, the lobster, and the risotto. The foie gas was creamy and rich, topped with a layer of caramelized sugar. It was delicious but also definitely a bit too rich as a starter.  The lobster was cooked to perfection. Perfectly seasoned. Perfectly cooked. Perfectly prepared. Perfectly executed. Need I say more?  The risotto, on the other hand, was an unpleasant surprise.  Maybe the chef accidentally mistaken 1 teaspoon of lime for 1 tablespoon of lime because the acidity was completely overwhelming. The lime empowered the whole dish and I could not taste anything but the lime. What a shame.  The waiter saw that I could not finish my risotto dish and offered to replace it with a different item but I graciously declined because I had already eaten half.  The desserts... oh WOW. The desserts were chosen by category and prepared on a large plate with four different types of desserts that fell within the category. In addition, we were also given complimentary marshmallow, mini macarons, small chocolate pieces, and variety of ice cream flavors.  The damage came out to $300+ for two that lasted 3 hours.  The food and experience definitely justify the price. I would go back and try their cheaper lunch alternatives next time I'm in NYC. Jean-Georges is the one four-star New York Times restaurant I had yet to do. The interior - with lush, off-white seating, in a large-windowed room off of Central Park - is something out of a Manhattan storybook. You could imagine Amelia Bedelia eating here. Compared to Per Se or 11 Madison, Jean George is much more down-to-Earth, in the sense that I could dine there every week without busting a gut. The tasting menu was short but sweet. The restaurant offers two of them - a standard and a seasonal - so you could go four times a year without getting a repeat meal. The striking thing is how innovative the food is compared to how traditional, or even innocent, the restaurant seems. Tastes are bold and varied, with plenty of Asian influence. Our short tasting menu featured wasabi, smoked chili, and BBQ sauce. The egg caviar, above, tastes like God personally made you breakfast in bed. The three star does not reflect the absolute level of dinning experience, but rather the relative level compared to my lofty expectation for a Michelin 3 star restaurant. The Egg Caviar is exquisite. The taste and the texture are both beyond imagination.  My next favorite is the Turbot. Turbot is usually steamed to preserve the soft texture in Chinese cuisine. So it is my first experience with a firm texture Turbot. It goes very well with chteau chalon sauce. The dessert is also amazing. Waves of flavor, sweet, sour and bitter, feel like a taste bud orchestra. Bread selection is plenty and all taste fresh. Wine and cocktail are high price high quality, as one would expect. Not a big fan of lobster or Squab. I understand historically they are rare treat and what not, but it is really white elephant to me.  The service matches the reputation. It is definitely a pleasant dining experience, just not sure if it warrants a special travel trip, which is pretty much what I did... It is extremely fancy and formal. It's situated right next to Central Park and is a pleasing setting. The noise level is fine, and the servers are extremely courteous. The little wooden salt bowl and spoon are very cute. The servers very thoroughly explained each dish as it arrived at our table. The food itself was amazing. Everything was cooked to perfection and exactly to our taste. The beef tenderloin was exquisite, as was the dessert. How could one not give this place five stars?? The service was seamless, hand and foot. The decor is a perfect balance of cozy, but clean. The food was delicious, though my salmon was over salted slightly. It wasn't severe enough to ruin the meal, only mildly detract from the one dish. The dessert tasting menu was terrific for chocolate. The price is high here, but you're definitely getting your money's worth. My second favorite 3-star Michelin restaurant. My fiance and I had gone for our anniversary and decided to try their lunch menu. We were seated by the window as requested at the time of making the reservation. Our main server was an absolute pleasure, however the other female (her trainee?) was not. We decided to overlook that because our main server was just that wonderful. The restaurant is elegant but comfortable. The lunch menu is a steal and a must! We both started with one of their signature cocktails which were made well. Our dishes: 1) Diver Scallop \"Ceviche\", Market Chilies and Lime 2) Gulf Shrimp, Water Chestnuts, Saffron, Silken Kabocha and Chipotle 3) Butternut Squash Soup with Black Trumpet Mushrooms 4) Sesame Crab Toast, Miso-Mustard, Asian Pear and Shiso 5) Black Sea Bass, Roasted Brussels Sprouts, Spiced Apple Jus 6) Parmesan Crusted Organic Chicken, Artichoke, Basil and Lemon Butter - the scallop ceviche was my personal favorite, followed by the shrimp Dessert: We decided on the Chocolate tasting: Mexican Chocolate Beignet, Chipotle Glaze and Sea Salt White Chocolate Meringue, Meyer Lemon Ice and Cinnamon Jean Georges' Chocolate Cake and Vanilla Bean Ice Cream Bitter Chocolate Candy Bar When my fiance had first made the reservation, he had mentioned it was our one year anniversary. To our surprise, they brought another dessert with a candle & \"Happy first anniversary\" written on a piece of white chocolate. Wonderful touch. Overall a great dining experience, and I would recommend it to others I had a really nice brunch here with friends. The tuna tartare was exceptionally good. The food was good and the ambiance was nice overlooking the park. I would most definitely go back. Amazing customer service. I had a very mixed experience here. After acknowledging my reservation, the host had us wait at the lobby for more than 15 minutes for the other lady to hang our coats and another waiter to lead us to our table. The decor was beautiful. There is no disagreement there. It is a great place to have a great conversation.   Dishes Ordered: Foie Gras Brule, Dried Sour Cherries, Candied Pistachios, and White Port Gelee Santa Barbara Sea Urchin, Black Bread, Jalapeo and Yuzu Crispy Confit of Suckling Pig, Rutabaga \"Pudding\" and Smoked Marmalade Caramelized Wagyu Beef Tenderloin, Delicata Squash Confit, Mole with Sherry Vinegar cocktail, Madeira, and Caramel  My favorites were the foie gras brulee and suckling pig. The crusty, sweet, and full flavor of foie gras paired with port gelee was wonderful combination. The suckling pig had a wonderful texture and flavor is wonderful with the marmalade. One complaint is with the crust, it is impossible to cut through and messed up the plating while I was trying.   Another part I enjoy is the small appetizers in between dishes as well as the small desserts at the end. An overrated part is the specialty marshmellow. I've had better homemade marshmellows with similar texture, but better flavor. The service was wonderful - as it is with all the high end restaurants.  The food was great, but not amazing. My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday for lunch and ordered from the Tastes of Autumn lunch menu. I had the Foie Gras Brule and Hake and my boyfriend had the Sea Trout Draped in Trout Eggs and the Caramelized Beef Tenderloin. Everything was good, but not memorable or mind-blowing - which was something I am usually looking for when dining at 3 Michelin star restaurants. Our favorite dish was the beef tenderloin - it was cooked perfectly.  The homemade sodas are also fun and delish. My bf ordered a juice and it was definitely refined.  We also ordered dessert - something with strawberry of sorts but was not overly impressed. Also, I'm not sure why everyone raves about the homemade marshmallow -- it is at the end of the day, only a marshmallow!  Although I cannot complan as the prices are relatively reasonable for 3 Michelin star French dining - still wondering where the 3rd star is though. What can I say this was an amazing meal. I loved the sous vide egg yolks and brittle crust, Delicious, I loved the pear dessert with coated hazelnuts. I absolutely loved their beef and all of the desserts (my favorite was the PB and J macaroon). The meal did take three hours but the amazing view of the park and the lovely atmosphere leaves nothing to be desired. Oh, Jean-Georges. I'm in love with you. After a stroll through Central Park watching the autumn leaves fall, New York officially stole my heart. And just when I thought I couldn't possibly fall in love with New York any more than I already had...Jean-Georges proved me wrong.  The dining experience surpassed all of my high expectations. The word perfect doesn't suffice! Service is above and beyond. The ambiance is very elegant and relaxed. And the food... is perfection. I absolutely loved loved loved the foie gras brul, duck confit, and tuna ribbon. Highly recommended. Make reservations for lunch for their prix fixe, amazing deal. I can't say this enough... Jean-Georges, I'm in love with you!!! I came to Jean Gorges for my 2 year anniversary. I had dined at other 5 star establishments, however my experience at Jean Gorges was like no other. Everything from the service to the quality of food was superb.  I was most impressed at the timing and cooking techniques each dish had. You could tell the servers are instructed at the right moment to bring the dish from the kitchen to the table. For instance, the temp of the egg caviar was perfect. Any hotter and the eggs would have over cooked. The same could be said for the fish and the buttery texture.  This place deserves 6 stars We came in on time and they had some hassle seating us.  We ordered the tasting menu, it was ok but many of the dishes just didn't stand out or were that exceptional for what you expect at an establishment like this. I was disappointed. I have been to Daniel's and was so impressed so I had high hopes for Jean George's. Nostalgic for days gone by when people dressed to go to dinner? When liveried footmen hovered obsequiously at your elbow to see to your every imagined dining need? When ladies withdrew to allow the gentleman to have civilised conversation over brandy and cigars? Well, then you must go to Jean-Georges. Its silver service here - there's no chummy familiarity from the waiters. Certainly not! All are very proper and very conscious of their own importance in the dining experience. Make no mistake the service is impeccable - the waiters know every ingredient and every technique used. They know that dining here is not just about the eating - its about the show, the experience, the spectacle...creating the mood as they - *voila* - remove the silver cloches all at once. You sense, every time a delectable, jewel-like edible adventure is set before you - that someone has taken incredible care, put in incredible thought to create this just so. And while I enjoyed some menu items more than others, every mouthful was an experience in flavour and textures. Dining at JG is like an evening at the opera. It's a little snooty, a little of a throwback - but when the soprano hits the high notes - well..then...you forgive it for being a little showy and diva-ish and you just revel in the mastery of the art. We came here to celebrate a special event, great place, great food, great atmosphere ! 5 stars as always! Universally terrific food (Sea Scallops, Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons, Japanese Risotto, Seared Gulf Shrimp with Baby Artichokes, Roasted Maine Lobster, Colorado Lamb, and Fig desserts) and service.  Sharing two prix fixe menus is more than enough food and variety. A++ I surprised my wife for her birthday here and she absolutely loved it. I knew the prices before we came and it was worth every penny. The yellow fin tuna ribbons with avocado, spicy radish, and ginger marinade was out of this world good. I also tried the crisps confit of suckling pig with baby beets and ginger vinaigrette which was simply amazing. The desert course was equally stunning, quite a selection of sweets, ice creams, and other textures that are simply the things dreams are made of.  Well played Jean-Georges, well played. 4.75 stars. Came here for lunch. Overall restaurant experience was not as good as Le Bernardin, mainly because of service. Coat check girl had minor attitude, as well as the reservationist. Waiters/waitresses did not move as seamlessly as those at Le Bernardin, and more than once, they confused the dishes that my friend and I ordered. Complimentary bread: choice of 3, the one with all of the nuts and seeds and dried fruit in it was my favorite because it had a great chewy texture and awesome flavor. The butter on the table was also REALLY GOOD. Damn.  Complimentary amuse bouche: roasted beets on a pecan toast was good, cold sashimi was good, the BEST and one of the most memorable flavors of the meal was the sweet potato soup with dashi broth and topped with parmesan foam, served in a small glass. PHENOMENAL FLAVORS and perfectly well-balanced, I couldn't get enough of it.  APPETIZERS Sea Trout Draped in Trout Eggs, Lemon and Olive Oil, served with crispy rye toast: good, the trout was fresh and brightened up by the lemon juice. The crispy rye toast was the perfect vehicle by which to enjoy this dish. Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons, Avocado and Spicy Radish, Ginger Marinade: delicious beautiful fresh ribbons of tuna served on top of thinly sliced radishes and a big mound of mashed avocados, delicious.  Foie Gras Brul, Dried Sour Cherries, Candied Pistachios, and White Port Gelee: my favorite: my FAVORITE appetizer. The foie gras was prepared like a creme brulee, with the top all sugared up and caramelized, which made it absolutely delicious. Each component added something delicious and textural to the dish: The sour cherries added a delicious sourness and chewiness, pistachios a nice nuttiness and crunchy texture, and the white port gelee was light and melted in your mouth, bringing it all together. This was really well done, I'd definitely get this again. Sea Scallops, Caramelized Cauliflower, Caper-Raisin Emulsion: it's not that I didn't like this, but it was the least memorable. The scallops were perfectly cooked, the cauliflower was nicely browned, but the flavors didn't pop out. A good dish that was well-composed, but not my favorite. ENTREES Red Snapper Crusted with Nuts and Seeds, Sweet and Sour Jus: my FAVORITE entree. The red snapper was beautifully cooked and was crusted with almonds, hazelnuts, and some subtle spices. It was flaky, soft, and oh so delicious. The sweet and sour jus really brought the whole dish together and was lick-your-bowl-clean delicious. The dish also had a bunch of other seasonal vegetables in there: red onion, parsnip, sweet potatoes, potatoes, etc that were perfectly cooked. Our waitress told me that this item has been on the menu for a very long time--I can definitely see why. I would definitely come back to eat this again.  Sweetbreads with Glazed Chestnut and Black Truffle Vinaigrette: this dish was also very very good. If you love sweetbreads, you will love this dish. They are lightly seasoned and then pan-fried in butter, and the glazed chestnuts on top are just, oh god, just so good, they just enhance the flavors of the sweetbreads. The black truffle vinaigrette was not too overpowering, but just completed the dish. I would definitely come back and order this, too! It's a fantastic seasonal dish. Sauted Veal Scallopine, Flying Pig Ham, Mushrooms and Lavender: delicious, although I didn't taste much lavender. The veal is also lightly seasoned and pan-fried. The fresh mushrooms are freakin delicous on top of it. Yummy. Caramelized Wagyu Beef Tenderloin, Delicata Squash Confit, Mole with Sherry Vinegar: this dish was a tad salty, but nothing to complain about too much. The caramelized wagyu beef tenderloin was PERFECTLY cooked (we requested medium rare). The mole was wonderful: a beautiful silky texture with cashews and chocolate and other spices in it (but it wasn't spicy at all). The delicata squash confit was a touch salty, but still delicious. If you want meat, this is your dish! DESSERT Black Pepper Crme Caramel, Chocolate Caramel Tart, Salted Caramel Ice Cream: beautiful and delicious. The black pepper on the creme caramel was very subtle, delicious. the chocolate caramel tart had some gold leaf on it. Seriously, who doesn't enjoy eating gold? Hahaha.  White Chocolate Meringue, Meyer Lemon Ice and Cinnamon, Jean Georges' Chocolate Cake, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream: the famous chocolate cake was served warm with gooey rich chocolate lava flowing out of it as soon as you cut into it. Omg. My favorite dessert. The Meyer Lemon Ice and cinnamon added really nice acidity to the dish. Complimentary marshmallow had a heavenly texture and had real vanilla bean in it. Nom. Complimentary little treats: nougat with pistachios and cranberries, spiced pumpkin macaroons, 2 different kinds of chocolates, candied spiced sweet potato (?) were all delicious and well done.  This place has 4 stars in NYT and 3 Michelin stars. Seriously, you can't go wrong Food was good, but service was even better! We had a party of 2 and after taking the waitress' advice we decided to try the $128/person prix fixe menu. She said we would be stuffed even the prix fixe menu only had 3 dishes, and plus I asked if we could add extra items from the prix fixe menu if we wanted to and she said yes. The prix fixe menu has 3 sections and you choose 1 dish from each. If you want to add an additional dish, the 1st section is about $28, 2nd section is about $30-40, 3rd section is about $60 (I don't remember the exact $, just approx.). The waitress came check on us when we were around half or almost done with our each dish. Bread was offered when they see your bread plate empty, and they constantly refilled your water. At the end, we were too full to finish the main course (we had the suckling pig and duck breast) and dessert (chocolate and summer tasting). I think for a 3 star Michelin restaurant, their pricing was very decent! Oh last thing, they required formal attire, but don't worry, they provide jackets to gentlemen at the reception. On my last day of vacation to NYC, I decided to go all out for lunch. I ordered fois gras, scallops, hamachi, sea bass, and the citrus dessert. In addition, since I was celebrating my birthday they gave me the cutest complementary chocolate present dessert. Inside the present was chocolate cake with a raspberry, some chocolate balls and chocolate mousse. It was alot of fun to eat. The food was pretty good, but I was expecting more for a 3 michelin star restaurant. Overall a wonderful experience with great food, classy atmosphere, and outstanding service. Furthermore, my server was very knowledgeable about the menu, and that is always a plus. Made an account just to review! I'm stuck between giving it a 3 and a 4, so if 3.5 was an option it would get that. Went for lunch. The food was ...underwhelming and the atmosphere, I know it's fine dining, was intimidating and was a little uncomfortable. I ordered the veal, which was average, and my boyfriend ordered the Arctic char, which was amazing. It totally melted in your mouth. The veal plate was sloppy - the sauce was everywhere and somewhat dripping over the side. His world famous lava cake changed my life. Seriously. It may be the best thing I have ever eaten. YOU HAVE TO TRY IT! The service was impeccable. Of course this is Jean George's doing - everything is timed. The decor is beautiful and elegant and the big windows during the day are really pretty. I've been here for dinner as well as lunch - both are amazing. The dinner is memorably orgasmic and the lunch is a steal for the price. The menu changes with the seasons so what I say is tasty is probably replaced by something new but just as tasty. The dining room is consistently classy and service is very polite- they certainly keep up with the high quality of the food.  The amuses are generally really fun, this past summer's lunch's being fried okra, carrot puree, and uni toast. Jean Georges cooking is extremely versatile and blends French and Asian flavors together very well. JG often has GNOCCHI on the menu - ORDER IT. They consistently put out the best gnocchi I've eaten, only bested by later variations of the dish. While desserts are amazing, a tip for those w/o a giant sweet tooth is to just skip dessert and save room for the petit fours. The marshmallows have been there for years and for good reason- they are the lightest most delicious marshmallows in town.  I could go on, but bottom line, everything here is cooked extremely well - especially the asian-influenced fish dishes. Do eat here, it'll be a special occasion.  Also a tip: if you think you see Jean Georges Vongerichten himself, don't pinch yourself. He's for real, and often oversees the dining room. I tried to paparazzi him like a geeky fanboy, but he ruined it by wandering over and asking me how I liked my meal. I liked it quite much. ***Lunch Review*** Me: Hamachi Sashimi & Crispy Confit of Suckling Pig BF: Foie Gras Brul & Caramelized Beef Tenderloin Extra plate to share: Peekytoe Crab Dumplings I rate all of these dishes a 10. Ten being the best. Before you even get what you ordered, le chef makes a pre-taster plate just to get your taste buds wanting more. And man...trust...you'll want more. For drinks, my bf ordered a black Manhattan. I can't tell you if it was good or not but he said it was. I ordered a virgin mint Mojito. I don't drink alcohol hence the virgin part. The drink was delicious! (Virgins are great!) I only thought of a virgin Mojito cause at the Milk and Honey speakeasy lounge, Rene made me a virgin drink so I wouldn't feel left out but that's a whole other review.  Dessert Time. 3-4 different small desserts themed by flavor Me: Chocolate BF: Strawberry Score of 10!  Service: Best I've ever experienced and I've gone to some top-notch restaurants Atmosphere: Clean, white and simple cause the focus is on the food  Then after dessert, le chef again, makes a small dessert plate with different chocolates. Man...SPOILED! I am SPOILED.  Doesn't sound like we ordered a lot but we were super full. Our bill came out to be a pretty shiny penny but all worth it. The experience, the food, the location (Inside Trump building). Next time we're in NY, I'm making reservations to come back to Jean-Georges. Merci pour la grande experience. Note: 3 star Michelin restaurant Of course it is great food. I have been here a few times, last time on Dec. 30th for lunch with some friends. However, something is just missing. This restaurant has 3 stars in the Michelin guide, and it is a mystery to me. ( !!! ) I come from Denmark (now living in NYC), and the level of Danish 1-star restaurants is totally different - to the top. And I am talking about everything; the lack of smiles and humor from the waiters and waitresses, the food that isn't top-notch, the toilets with cheap paper (and one of the times I visited it, Italian pop-music!?), and the level of incompleteness in the service. Fx wiping off 1/10 of the breadcrumbs on the table and ignoring the rest. The macarons that didn't seem fresh. The tea that wasn't 'the best'. And I could continue. I expect more from you, Jean-Georges. This place is special to me as my fiance took me here for my birthday/ our first dinner after being engaged in NY. I don't really have much to say as all the reviews have said it all. Located inside a hotel, I didn't expect such a nice place. Dim ambiance, with minimal lighting enough for you to taste with your eyes before you eat it with your mouth. My fiance and I got the chef's tasting menu. I got the winter tasting menu and my fiance got the regular one so we can try all the amazingness that Jean-George could offer. The food was obviously top notch as it is a 3-michelin star restaurant. The sommelier was super knowledgeable and recommended a champagne that wasn't wallet busting but still a great great champagne. The service was amazing as well, every dish was served with a smile and knowledge of everything on the plate. The only thing I do have to \"complain\" about is that the servers come out like ninjas to take your plates away! hahaha I had to laugh. They were very inconspicous so you wouldn't even know that they are there! Again there isn't much to say. I can't explain all the food because that is just redundant in my opinion...afterall..you just have to go try it for yourselves! Food is outstanding and service is professional and at the level the know how to sell and describe the menu. The only negative thing is the smell of fried food you get on your clothes the should improve the kitchen aspirators you should not smell of Chinese food after you go from this amazing restaurant. 3 michelin star given to Chef Jean-Georges My first 3 star michelin rated restaurant.. What more can I say? Of course, I don't have much to compare to but it definitely did not disappoint me one bit. The lunch deal at this 3 star rated restaurant is beyond out of this world. If you can't afford dinner here yet, lunch is definitely a great alternative to experience what the differences are in michelin star rated restaurants.  2 course prix fixe menu $38. This will definitely fill you up for a lunch. Trust me. ++ Amuse Bouche- 3 tastes of summer: fried sushi topped with salmon belly, fried okra in black sesame sauce, and salmon puree soup. These were delicious and flavorful, each in their owns ways. Great start to a great meal.  1. Hamachi Sashimi- topped with avocado sauce and radish. Eat them all together in one and voila, it was heavenly pieces, melting in your mouth. 2. Wagyu Beef- medium rare in butter sauce with butternut squash. The beef was well prepared and a very reasonable size. This was an additional $10ish I believe.  3. Late Harvest Season- I wasn't too impressed with this dessert. It had peach compost with jelly, and marinated figs. I forgot what else it came with.. but the flavors were a bit too much for me. 4. Macaroons, Chocolates, & homemade vanilla bean marshmallows- so many to choose from since they provided you complimentary goodies. 4 different types of chocolates included with everything else! I also got to try the sea bass and yellowtail tuna... these were AMAZING.. Jean-Georges is amazing with his sauces and ingredients. Even if it may just be a slice of fish, his whole entire dish makes up for it. He is full of flavor (but not too overpowering) and I love it. Venue screams out classy and sophisticated. I love the brightness to the formal dining room with its high windows and ceilings. Service was almost impeccable even though I thought they slowed down a bit too much towards the end. Very caring and polite to your needs. I will DEFINITELY come back again!!! I had such high expectations. A 3 Michelin starred restaurant should pretty much blow you away, shouldn't it?  Lunched here with a party of four, and sampled an array of dishes and desserts. The food was beautifully presented and was in no way bad, but it didn't have that special something that I expected out of a restaurant of this caliber. I found our waiter to be a little aloof rather than welcoming as well.  The amuse bouches, the yellowfin tuna ribbons, and the complimentary purple macarons were probably my favorite parts of the meal. I sampled a portion of the foie gras brulee and thought it was impeccably done as well. I personally ordered the comte risotto and the red snapper, and although both were fine, neither really were anything to sing praises about. In truth, I regret not dishing out a few more bucks for the sea scallops. Or the egg caviar. To be fair, their lunch prices are very reasonable. All in all, I have very mixed feelings about this place. As my first fine-dining experience in New York, I expected so much and was let down. As the same time, are they to blame for my high expectations, especially during a lunch service at that? I didn't think that any of the dishes were poorly executed or flawed in any way. They just didn't elicit any fond feelings. I definitely plan on coming back some day, for the dinner service. I would still come back for the lunch service as well - I would just order different items. My expectations are still high, I still have great respect for this institution, and I have this blind confidence that my next dining experience here will be more impressive. For now, it's still 4 stars because of the incredible value. Service was excellent, although the food was only good. The dining room is much more formal, but the captain in charge of our table (head server) was incredibly knowledgeable, and awesome. They did not have the pea soup, sadly, it was a spring offering. I don't recall the appetizer, scallops, being that good, sad to say,, but the braised short rib was decent, but really not out of this world. My favorite was the desserts. We got the vanilla something to share, with the warm chocolate molten cake. It was supposed to take 20 minutes or so from when we ordered, but because we were in a rush, the captain got one to us really quickly (less than 5 minutes). I'm sure he snatched it from another table, or maybe the kitchen had an extra made... but still, totally appreciated! Also, there were little home made chocolates for the table, and you are always welcome to ask for more, and they are so good about it.  Love the service and the special touches, not so much the appetizers and entrees. Dessert is out of the world, as is the service. Definitely worth it for the experience, although at $70 per person, it was not the most satisfying meal from a food perspective. Great for business lunches though. Service is excellent. The signature seven-course meal exceeds my expectation though bread and desserts are just okay. My first time dining at this restaurant was a couple days after Christmas. I had the four course meal (left side of the menu, for those who have been recently). I had the yellowfin tuna, mushroom risotto, Parmesan-crusted chicken with artichokes and a basil lemon sauce and a custom dessert because of my gluten allergy. As soon as I told our server about my allergy, within a minute I had my own gluten-free bread sitting in front of me and the chef prepared try dishes accordingly so I could enjoy them without worry (and I say this with 100% certainty because I would feel sick pretty quickly and I never experienced any discomfort at all!). From the hor d'oeuvres to the last course, I was served customized plates that were described to me in detail. There was never a moment of hesitation when I asked questions - no going to ask the chef. The staff know the menu and ingredients inside and out. This is one of my all-time favorite restaurants and we will surely be going back again and again! The service was impeccable, the wine was superb, the food was divine and the atmosphere is fabulous. Five stars all around! I'm a little torn about this place. Nice setting, very good food. Also, it's a great value for what you're getting. The service was ok, but for a Michelin starred restaurant there were little hiccups you wouldn't expect. Wine dribbled on the table, a somewhat rude hostess, etc. The food, though, like I said, is very good. Best thing I had: seed-crusted black bass. Great texture on the crust, moist and delicious flesh. Really an outstanding dish! Again, some of the food is four star to five star. The service is probably three star. This should average out to 4.5 stars but since I can't give a half star, I'll round down. Sorry Jean-Georges, if you work out the service issues I'll give you 5 stars next time! Dining at Jean George is a once in a lifetime event.  My bf and I talked about how there's no way we'd be able to afford an extravagant dinner here anytime soon, so their $32 prix fixe lunch was the next best thing.  I love how the dining room is understated yet elegantly furnished, with the big windows that look out to Columbus Circle on one side and Central Park on the other. The decor is clean with lots of light hues and pretty chandeliers hanging from the high ceiling. Seating was arranged where you're not too close to hear your neighbor's conversation.  Their cocktail list has a lot of light and fruity options on the menu, I'd imagine this is so because they dont want their patrons getting hammered at lunch, you are dining at Jean George after all! * wink * I ordered the Clementine Fizz with gin and fresh juice, topped off with sparkling wine. I needed a bright, happy drink. Bf said his whiskey sour was watered down. Our amuse bouche came shortly after and presented our palettes on what was to come: Crepe filled with mushrooms and cheese, rye toast with mustard mayo and radish and carrot juice with kaffir lime.  Their sea trout sashimi were sizable cubes of fish sitting in lemon, dill and horseradish sauces. Although the fish was fresh, I think the horseradish overpowered this dish a bit.  The foie gras brulee with meyer lemon jam is any foie gras lover's dream come true. I mean, its so hard to come up with words to describe this dish: it was decadent and sinfully rich.  Their beef tenderloin is tender and flavorful. While the chicken parmesan with white asparagus was good, this dish fell flat for me. The flavors were one dimensional -- I just tasted cheese. That's it. If not for the creamy sauce, I would've felt like I made a wrong entree choice.  The dessert stole the show! it was a duo of caramel flavors presented as an espresso-caramel ice cream and a salted-caramel chocolate hazelnut tart with creme fraice ice cream. Totally blew away my tastebuds!  Service was professional but not aloof. I like that a multitude of people catered to our every need, we were totally treated like they are happy to have our business there. (although, I'm still wondering why I didn't get the complimetary marshmallows like everyone around me did?) If you want the 3 Michelin star experience without the 4 $$$$ sign, Jean George should be on your list of places to try, at least for a nice business lunch. Located in the Trump Tower building, it's really easy to get here via the Metro system. Plenty of trains travel through Columbus Circle so no need to drive or anything. Although jacket is required. This is one of the top in fine dining. The service was impeccable, the food was outstanding, and everything else was pretty much perfect. Even for a table for one, I got to enjoy all that JG had to offer. My lull time included just people watching. Everyone getting all semi-fancied up and all. Seeing a great variety of people kept me entertained. After all, I was eating for about 2.5 hours. I did their \"Summer Menu\" with several tasting courses. The amouche bouche was a watermelon, cucumber dill pickle, popcorn miso soup. It's like an energy drink, but fancy and stuff.  I started off with their softly poached egg, caviar, yogurt and herbs. Yum, I'm not used to having caviar, but it was nice and smooth. Definitely a delite to have this once in awhile.  Next was the yellowfin tuna with five flavors. From left to right, the tuna was wrapped in jalepeno, radish, fennel, ginger and surrel. The yuzu dipping sauce complimented well with the tuna.  The third dish was the charred corn ravioli with cherry tomato salad and basil fondue. I never had corn ravioli before so this was a new surprise for me. Great, comforting food.  The black bass with sea bean radish salad and white sesame and lavender was next. Nice aromatic smell and the black bass was nice and flaky.  The roasted Maine lobster with market corn and smoked chili almond emulsion was next. The lobster was fatty and juicy.  More meat came as the rack of Colorado lamb with tender summer beans with fresh tomato barbecue sauce was next on the menu. Very, very tender piece of meat. Lots of juices on this lamb. And the barbecue sauce was more of like a chipotle tomato jam. So it was more on the sweet side.  For dessert there was a plethora of pear tart, sorbet,   chocolates, macarons and marshmallows.  . Yes I got some more of my macaron fix!!! Bottom line is that if you have the time and a few extra dollars lying around, then I would take a date here or celebrate something special here. You won't be disappointed. Make sure to call and make the reservations in advance. Michelin 3 star I was very disappointed with Valentine's Day menu and restaurant at all. I had a feeling me and my husband had a date with different couple, tables are too close to each other. Menu was disappointed too, I sent one dish back it was too spicy, they replaced it with same spicy dish just different flavor. Out of 7 courses 4 was over spice for me, it was different kind of spice, but my mouth wanted some break. After your dinner in any Michelin restaurant they give you a little present to go, cookies, chocolates, they give us nothing!!! Service was not great too, we were need to ask to take our plates. I have been at Daniel, Aquivit, Boulad, Gordon Ramzi (when he had his 2 stars), Bouley and so on. Sorry but it was not good.I will never come back again. Came here for the pre-fix lunch one afternoon and had the best dining experience of my life (no exaggeration here). No wonder this place is so reputable, because the service and food was just as good as it gets when it comes to fine dining. First of all, make reservations EARLY. The earliest I could get on a Friday afternoon was 2:30 pm. This was ideal for a day off, but if you're going for say a business lunch, plan in advance. With that said, we had a wonderful host and captain; they were impeccable. I was very surprised that our captain was only 20! And she was as well trained as any that I've ever met. My first impression when I walked in was that it was very understated and simple, which I loved. Clean lines, beautiful chandelier, white table clothes and simple, comfortable seats.  To start, we had the tuna ribbons with avocado, scallops, the peeky toe crab dumplings, and the uni toast. Each plate was as good as the last; from the dressing in the tuna to the uzu and jalapeno on the uni toast, everything was just spectacular. I was surprised but also delighted that the dishes had somewhat of a thai flair/flavor. After all this, I was still excited for our entrees. We ordered the suckling pig and the cod. I really couldn't tell you which one was the star of the show because they were equally heavenly. The suckling pig had a wonderful jalapeno puree and fig jam to accompany it, while the fish had a hearty broth with it that you just wanted to drink.  Then came dessert- oh boy. I don't even know how we made it to this point, but we ended up with a little dessert sampler accompanied by a chocolate cake, petit fours, and homemade marshmallows. We also ordered some coffee to stay awake because at this point I was in a food coma. My favorite of the dessert sampler was the grapefruit tart and the meyer lemon creme brulee, however I can see why the chocolate cake is a favorite for patrons. I'd come back here in a heartbeat if it means I can experience this exquisite meal again. My husband had the pleasure of dining at this fantastic restaurant. The food was spectacular. This is restaurant is well worth visiting. We will definitely visit one of Jean Georges' restaurants in the future. Do not miss this dining experience Jean George is definitely overrated. Not sure what he's been making the past few decade that's got him famous, but for such high end 3 michelin star restaurant, the food tasted like average. For the food you get $198 (signature dish course) is overpriced as well. For the two of us with two glasses of wine we ended up paying $550. The service was great, which means nothing to me if the food is not worth the pay.  The egg caviar tasted like an average scrambled eggs with the caviar on top slightly salty. The lobster was bland the duck was mediocre nothing really special except that it was really hard to cut that the juice splashed on to my clothes. The frog leg was mediocre again with a young garlic sauce that was sour and had a weird sour plus eery sensation when you swallow it. The desert was the best of all but still didn't fascinate my taste buds.  Overall, nothing special about these food. Pity for Jean George. I should've just gone to Michael Richard Citronelle's restaurant. Best meal ever! Jean-Georges is the best restaurant in nyc! I'm totally recommend this restaurant. If you are willing to spend some big bucks, this place is heaven. Every dish (that my party of 6) tasted was an explosion of delicious flavors. Every plate was perfectly cooked and executed. Even the bread was perfect- especially the ciabatta.  I had the chicken parm, and it was the best chicken parm I have ever had. It had the perfect, pan fried edge with just the right amount of cheese and a delicious sauce. The desserts were spectacular - especially the chocolate lava cake with white chocolate ice cream. To top it off, the home made marshmellows and mini macarons were a pleasant way to end the meal. AMAZING !!!! Service+Food+Decor+Space+Vibe I was there for a thursday brunch, and so happens jean-george was there too. What surprise me was the way he works the room, saying hello and chatting away to everybody he knows, which i think its the greatest experience a owner can give to it's customers...recognition. A owner that cares about his clients as much as he cares about the food.  All the dishes i had was perfectly executed, from timing, temperature, presentation, to the fabulous layers of taste evolves.... Loved: Amuse bouche & dessert comps...Excellent here (didn't enjoy daniel's or the modern at all) Egg Cavier Foie gras brulee Sea scallops, Caramelized cauliflower Definitely will be back to try everything on the menu.....A I've been to about 10 Michelin starred restaurants, and this place was the best out of all of them. While most of the other restaurants I went to had a more extensive tasting menu (a la Eleven Madison Park and their 5 hour long meal), Jean Georges served slightly larger portions and less courses, which gave me the feeling that I got to enjoy each dish more. Here is a more detailed recount of my experience A few of my friends were celebrating passing a licensing exam, and decided to come here for dinner. Very standard decor for what you would expect from a restaurant like this. Upon seating, we were presented the menu for food, wine and hard alcohol. I decided to go with the Jean George's tasting menu over the seasonal tasting menu. We all got an assortment of drinks, and while I am a huge scotch lover, I had to admit that my buddy's passion fruit margarita was the best drink I've ever had. Onto the food. They started us off with a complementary dish of three things, of which I only remember two of them (does not take away from the deliciousness of the third piece). They were a piece of salmon sashimi, a tomato juice, and something dipped in cream and jalapeno sauce. Even my friend who hated jalapenos loved the dish. Next was the caviar course, which was served in an eggshell over cream and scrambled egg. Absolutely blew my mind even though I was hesitant about the caviar. The consistency of the entire dish was perfect. The third course was scallops. I got so excited about eating this course I forgot to take a picture of it. Scallops were perfectly tender, an explosion of flavor that wasn't too overpowering. Next came the frog legs with soup. While the frog was a bit too sour, I thought the complement with the soup was really good. Almost like a blend of lemon with creamy soup. MMMMM Turbot was our next course. It was a perfect filet, surrounded by a corn flavored sauce. This was the best fish I've ever had in my life (excluding sashimi from really good sushi places =P), the flavor was blended perfectly such that every inch of my tongue felt amazing. The lobster course was the only one where I wasn't as pleased. Lobster is the dish that I feel should be made perfectly by restaurants of this caliber. While I think it was good, the meat was just a little stringy. Not too disappointed though The next dish was squab. Again, absolutely perfect, meat was super tender, and a healthy portion. The last and best part was the dessert. They gave us a platter of four chocolate dishes. The signature lava cake was so rich and delectable, just thinking about it makes me want to eat it forever and ever and ever. Overall, this place is a must try if you are into fine dining, and people really shouldn't complain about the price...it is pretty damn in line if not cheaper than other michelin star restaurants 2012 3 star Michelin This is probably the most disappointing 3 star restaurant Ive been to. This is not to say the food was bad, it was not. However, the food did not wow me like other 3 star establishments, and even some 2 star establishments. We opted for the Autumn tasting menu. 6 courses + amuse + petit fours. Service was decent, but not the best Ive had. Location, its actually in the inner part of Nougatine, Jean georges satellite restaurant.  Next time I come, I will opt for the ala carte option as it seems more economical and more flexible with your taste buds. The meal lasted close to 2 hours, not short by any means, but not marathon-esque like EMP (3.5 hours). This was my first 3 Michelin restaurant. I went here for my birthday and it was fantastic. Our server was the best server I've ever had. She was so knowledgable about the menu and made my boyfriend and I feel so special. I motioned to get up to go to the bathroom and she literally came over to pull out my chair and walk me to door! Food was great overall - the black bass was UNREAL, I would swim in the sauce it came with. They also put a candle in my dessert once they found out it was my birthday which was nice. The only slight negatives were that the amuse bouche we got was just ehh and the pork dish was a little cold but our experience as a whole was still wonderful. I will be coming back here ASAP! I came here with a few friends during their weekday lunch service, which I think is hands down one of the best \"value\" meals you can get at a Michelin restaurant. As other reviewers have mentioned, the weekday lunch offers a two-course option for $38 and any additional courses for $19 each. If you decide to get two entrees for the two-course option, there's an additional charge (hubby did this and they charged him an additional $10, which was approved by both chef and hubby beforehand). Hubby and I ended up getting 3 courses each out of curiosity's sake, but the portions were large enough that (in addition to the breads, amuse bouche, and mini desserts) two courses would've been plenty for lunch. Since I went here with friends, we ordered a variety of the options from the lunch menu and were able to try a bite of everything. All the dishes were delicious, but upon reflection of our meal from a month ago, I can honestly say that the most memorable parts of my meal there were the black bass and the house-made marshmallows. The black bass (crusted with nuts and seeds) had the perfect balance of textures and flavors; the crisp crust contrasted nicely with the tender, perfectly cooked fish, and the savory jus it came in just pulled it all together. The just-sweet and tender marshmallow was a satisfying end to a fantastic meal. Service was on par with what you'd expect from fine dining. Dress code for lunch is a little more relaxed than for dinner, but I recommend still dressing up a bit. If i could give six stars, I would.  This place is phenomenal in all categories: food, drink and experience. I went here for my 1st wedding anniversary and enjoyed the seasonal tasting menu with the wine pairing. If you have somewhere to be post dinner, be sure to give yourself some time because you are going to be there for at least 2.5-3 hours.  some dishes that stood out: egg caviar (to DIE for!) Santa Barbara Sea Urchin and the homemade sorbet assortment for dessert. To add to the experience, the waitstaff delivered a chocolate moose cake to our table with no indication from either of us to do so. The cake was in the shape of a gift box with the words \"happy 1st anniversary\" written on it. The waitstaff was super knowledgeable, friendly, and most importantly, unpretentious. The quality of food is worth the price, don't be intimidated by the small portions of food per course, remember, its a \"tasting\" .....i guarantee however, you will leave very full. I am glad that I chose Jean George to end my NYC dining experience this year. I am impressed mostly by the service. Unlike other Michelin 3 stars restaurants (we visited Le Bernardin and Eleven Madison Park on this trip), the wait staff has more relax (yet professional) approach. They crack small jokes with customer. I feel completely relaxed though out the meal. They replace the use napkin when you leave the table. All main courses are serve table side.  Overall the food is pretty good. Although, I did not like the use of popcorn as texture contrast (well I don't like popcorn period). Sauces are rich and delicious.  The food that are still stick in my mind Maine red prawn and Sea Urchin dish, it almost too pretty to eat and the prawn cooked to perfection. This is my favor dish Foie Gras cooked perfectly. The accompaniment are interesting, perfect balance of the salty and sweet with black olive dust and Lychee gelee. Only draw back is the gelee consistency reminds of me glue (sorry).  Dessert sampling is great you get to taste of one main ingredient in different ways.  Don't skip the marshmallow if you are full after the dessert courses. They are out of this world. A knight in shining armor took me here for our 2-year anniversary and it was absolutely surreal.  In addition to a delicious four course menu, we also enjoyed very generous portions of tasting samples. And for those who haven't tried arctic char, do not miss out!  The atmosphere was quite romantic and we were seated nicely in a corner to enjoy the night just between the two of us. The experience was unforgettable and I wouldn't change a thing. A real five star experience. JG is perfect for dinners and for parents visiting from out of town. Took my parents here and they loved it.  Memorable Dishes: foie gras, tuna ribbons, hamachi, salmon and snapper. Didn't fancy their take on beef. (Posted Pictures) WOW.  First of all I'd like to say that yelp is wrong and Jean Georges does open on Sundays and for lunch no less. You guys momentarily scared me when I was on the way to lunch. Tsc tsc.  I've been to well regarded restaurants before and while in most of these the food is fantastic what can really make your experience is fantastic service to match. Its sad to see beautiful restaurants with exceptional food that ruin your experience by treating you poorly. I can safely say that is NOT the case with Jean Georges. From start to finish it was a lovely experience and every cent I had to pay I considered extremely well spent. First off, we made reservations for 2 on Sunday and when we got there for some reason the reservation was no longer there and it showed up as cancelled. Nonetheless the host said it was no problem and they could accommodate us. We sat down with our party of 4 in 2 minutes. Our waitress (Nicole i believe) was all smiles and very friendly yet professional the whole time. Smiling is so simple and yet goes a long way in making your customers feel comfortable and welcome. She was accommodating and when we let her know I had to catch a flight at 530 in JFK she let us pay the bill in advance, rushed dessert, and didn't act like it was a hassle at all.  They give you 3 choices of bread; ciabatta, sourdough and norwegian bread and the butter is amazing stuff. Next came the amuse bouche which was a chilled carrot soup with creme fraiche, fried okra in a sesame sauce and toast with uni and jalapeno. None of my dining companions are a fan of uni, especially on toast it can be a bit too much for most but all three were great and a substantial amuse bouche ( I once went to a \"$$$$\" restaurant that gave us blueberry water for an amuse bouche -____- its exactly what it sounds like).  For lunch you can do a $38 2-course meal or the $168 multiple course tasting. We opted for the 38 dollar one and between the bread, the amuse bouche, 2 courses, a shared dessert and the pastries/chocolates they give you after we were all more than satisfied. We tried the pea soup with parmesan foam, charred corn ravioli in basil and shrimp with uni. The pea soup tasted incredibly fresh and you got a LOT of soup. The ravioli was amazing, the fresh corn and basil were sweet and summery. The shrimp was great because there was a lime zesty sauce that really balanced out how rich and creamy the uni was. For main courses we had the suckling pig with bacon jam (extra $10) , wagyu beef tenderloin with summer squash in a butter scotch bonnet sauce (extra $15) and parmesan crusted chicken with artichokes in a lemon cream sauce. All 3 of the meats were prepared perfectly and were super tender. I got the steak and even though it was delicious I kindof wish I had ordered something else because it was not as inventive as some of the other pairings.  For dessert we shared the chocolate (chocolate lava cake, vanilla ice cream, white chocolate meringue with lemon granita) and cherry (cherry marzipan creme brulee, cherry sorbet, deconstructed black forest cake). The chocolate was your typical lava cake and vanilla ice cream option but it was executed perfectly. The cherry dessert was a bit more creative and the creme brulee and sorbet were sooo smooth.  Lastly they give you enough sugar to make you realize you really didn't have to order dessert. Cassis macarons with an almost sorbet-like fresh filling, apricot jellys, filled chocolates (coconut, passion fruit,....other things), some oatmeal lavander cookie thing, caramels that were kindof spicy, and the BEST. MARSHMALLOWS. EVER. I've made homemade marshmallows before but instead of being fake jet-puffed marshmallows or the denser ones you make at home these were just magical vanilla clouds. Truth.  All in all, amazing food, SO many options to choose from, perfect execution, beautiful decor and EXCEPTIONAL service from every person you happen to cross paths with. Highly recommended. And totally worth having to sprint to the Delta ticketing booth at JFK and beg the lady to let me onto my flight. Unfortunately, I had a serious case of the \"yips\" when I was here. I kind of choked at the order stage of the evening.  I had just arrived in NYC around 9:00 p.m. after being sandwiched between two rows of yelling (and kicking) children throughout my 5 hour flight. I was a little exhausted and not prepared to go out to dinner. In fact, I had hoped to just grab a burger and a beer and call it an evening. But when my boss suggested we come here, I couldn't really disagree.  They had a summer ordering menu, which I thought sounded like a good idea because three courses were included. I ordered an heirloom tomato salad, the salmon entree, and panna cotta with raspberry sorbet. What I really wanted, however, was the lobster burger with gruyere and aioli, but again, I was plagued by a serious case of the yips.  By no means were my choices terrible, but I think JG's regular menu choices are far better than the seasonal menu (you'd think the opposite would be true, but not in my experience). The heirloom salad was great--for some reason it is very difficult to get a decent heirloom tomato on the West Coast, despite the fact that the West Coast is the best coast. The salmon entree was my least favorite. The salmon was a little undercooked for my taste, and the breading was bland, but the creamy lemon sauce it was served in was tangy and flavorful (although the texture was odd). The panna cotta dessert was fabulous. Who would have thought that raspberry sorbet would pair so well with panna cotta? That's a yummy flavor combination. My boss chose the molten chocolate cake with vanilla gelato, and I preferred that dessert over the one I chose. Mine was lighter (that's my story and I'm sticking to it).   The ambiance here is clean and modern, but I'm not a big fan of the crowd in attendance. We arrived around 10:30 p.m. When we walked in I immediately noticed a drunk couple at the end of the bar--he was at least 70 and she was probably 35-40. They (like most at the bar) were dressed to the nines--she in a tight-fitting LBD and he in a suit with a skinny tie--both with obvious spray tans. My boss summed them up best: \"These two seem straight out of Real Housewives.\" Seems like there are a ton of tourists at this spot as well. I personally prefer a much (MUCH) chiller crowd.  The service was pretty good, overall.  My favorite thing about JG was probably the wine list. My boss chose a fantastic bottle of wine. I actually wish I could remember the name of that white--it was a little bubbly and a little sweet, yet very smooth. We polished off the bottle easily.  Not bad. *********************** 756 *************************     I can't describe enough how much I love this Jean-Georges resto. This is the only 3 Michelin Starred resto in NYC offers the cheapest lunch tasting menu here. I wrote before Bouley was my FAV for 1 Michelin Starred lunch, but at Jean-Georges, it's a STEAL here!     I really don't have to talk about who chef Jean-Georges, he's in the league of Thomas Keller, Daniel Boulud, Masa, Eric Ripert, Masa, they were the only 5 restos in NYC got 3 Michelin stars, until chef Daniel Humm of EMP came along in OCT 2010.     I love the spacious dining room, the wall to ceiling glass window, I can sit and staring at the Time Warner building... Always go for TASTING MEU, you get so much food, not just any food, AMAZING food, so delicate, so much love put in to the last detail on the plate. I feel as I was the queen of the universe on each bite. - Amuse Bouch - soup, mushroom, foam, cheese. - Egg Caviar -his signature, reminded me of Le Bernardin egg, but more caviar, delish. - Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons, Avocado And Spicy Radish, Ginger Marinade - this dish was so beautifully presented, I didn't want to eat at all, a bit sour, tangy, and the flavor was so different than anything I have tried before. - The risotto with Matsutake mushroom from Japan - This was rich with parmesan cheese, but simply tasty on a cold rainy day of October. It's just warmed you up. - Skate with roasted pumpkin seeds, spaghetti squash and soy-yuzu broth - this was amazing, I didn't know what to expect, it was delicious. The aroma was so nice.  - Wagyu Tenderloin And Comteignets pear-horseradish pur - There was no way I could finish this, believe it or not, I had to take it home. It was so much food, the meat was perfectly cut, see photos.  DESSERTS: I don't even eat desserts, and this much for me!!! - Jean Georges Chocolate Cake And Vanilla bean ice cream. - Pomegranate Sorbet And Spiced Red Wine Syrup. - Salted Caramel Souffle passion fruit syrup - Chocolate Pear Cake with poire william geland pink pralines - A marshmallow cart - served at your table, fresh! How cool is that? And  - Mignardises - to go please.      While I was dining here, chatting up with this young beautiful sommelier, she worked at Per Se before, and was glad to see her here at Jean-Georges last OCT. She was so kind and talked me about food, wine, and how much she enjoyed working at JG. I will definitely come back, and hope to see her again this year.       Oh and be nice to Mr. Philippe Vongerichten, the GM, he might be able to get you a last minute table, only if you are polite! You might get lucky withno RSVP!      The service was flawless. They also offer Coconut water, and I loved it. So i've done all the 6 of the 3 Michelin Starred in NYC, Vegas, and Chicago. I've have dined at least a few times on each one. This is why I have to work out at least 12 hours a week :-)  Overall: 5 stars For value: 5 stars For Food: 5 stars For Service: 5 stars For ambiance: 5 stars Location: Trump Hotel - Upper Westside Park & Columbus Circle Food (4/5)  Decor (5/5)  Service (5/5)  Value (3/5) Restaurants like Jean-Georges are the occasional indulgence for me and if it costs $198 a head, my expectations start quite high. Jean-Georges has, unfortunately, disappointed me on quite a few occasions (ABC Kitchen as an example). However, I find the Asian inspirations in his cooking to be very interesting and was very excited to try his flagship restaurant. Before going more in depth, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed my experience, but for the price point, I think there are other better restaurants in NYC.  Upon walking into the restaurant, there is a feeling of class. Pristine white tablecloths and dishware along with plush chairs and amphitheater type seating. Don't forget that jackets are required for men, though one of the people in my party forgot and the restaurant provided him with a loaner jacket. The whole decor was somewhat stuffy as is common with these high end restaurants, but I suppose that is the trade off for both extremely high quality service and food. For our meal, we did the spring tasting menu. I think the two standout dishes were Meyer Lemon Gelee and Green Asparagus. The Meyer Lemon Gelee was served with caviar and the two were amazing paired together. I don't love lemon so I was particularly surprised by how much I enjoyed them together. The Green Asparagus was similarly surprisingly delicious. I would not normally think of asparagus as something that could be elevated, but this was cooked just to the right tenderness and served with a delicious mushroom based sauce. On the other end of the spectrum, the poached lobster was actually quite disappointing. I thought the flavors were a little lacking and the texture of the lobster was a bit mushy. Aside from these three dishes, everything else was delicious, but just didn't feel above and beyond, and for the most part, that is what I would expect from a restaurant like this.  Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and would enjoy returning in the future, but I don't find myself as excited to return to Jean-Georges as I am about some of my favorite restaurants, especially at this price point. My girlfriend had lunch here in July to celebrate a special occasional. Jean-Georges is a wonderful place to celebrate, as the staff really goes out of their way for you, without being pretentious about anything. The ambiance and decor of the dining room was also very nice, tho I imagine it would be a lot more intimate at night. From the moment we walked in and checked in at the hostess' stand, we were wished well, as we also were with every server who came to our table that afternoon. After being seated, we were brought menus and bread. The bread was brought around in a basket and we were allowed to choose from a few different kinds. The bread was also refilled during our meal, but not so much that you got full off bread before your meal arrived. After our bread was served, we looked over the food and drink menus. To drink, we stuck with water, tho I did have a glass of champagne before our meal. I can't remember what kind it was, but it was excellent and professionally served, with just a pour at first, before the entire glass was filled. As for our meal, we went with two courses. My girlfriend chose the Steamed Skate, which came with a New Onion Vinaigrette and Spring Vegetables, followed by the Beef Tenderloin. I chose the Sea Scallops w/Caramelized Cauliflower and a Caper-Raisin Emulsion, followed by the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Artichoke Basil and Lemon Butter. Before any of our courses were served, we received an amuse - I really can't remember a whole lot about it, other than it was served in a shot glass (similar to what the amuse at Nougatine was served in) and had watermelon and cucumber on the side. The amuse itself had popcorn in it and was maybe a miso-ginger soup of some kind? I'm really blanking on this one, but it was quite good. As for our first courses, the scallops and skate were both yummy. Perhaps the scallops were a little thin and there were only three of them, but the carmelized cauliflower and caper-raisin emulsion complemented the scallops very well. As for the skate, it was a unique flavor - one that I was not used to, but I liked it. Skate may not be for everyone, but Jean Georges did an excellent job of preparing and serving it. Moving on to the main courses, the Parmesan Crusted Chicken - it was well prepared and yummy, but I found it to be rather standard and noting to rave about. My girlfriend's tenderloin, however, was on a completely different scale. She ordered it medium - I personally prefer my meat medium rare or rare - but even cooked medium, this was the most tender tenderloin I'd ever had. It literally melted in your mouth. Even if you wanted to chew this more, you couldn't, since it melted. It was even better than the tenderloin that is served at Nougatine. Moving onto dessert, we opted just to have one dessert - the Market Strawberry Tasting. Made up of a Strawberry Red Wine Sorbet, Lemon Verbena Chantilly, Vanilla Sponge and a Balsamic Meringue, this dessert was heavenly, phenomenal and out of this world. I really can't describe it - try it for yourself. Any shortcomings that were present in any of the dishes were erased with this one dessert. As our lunch here was celebratory, we were also served a chocolate moose cake, with a raspberry in the middle, complete with edible gold, with white chocolate that had well wishes written on it. This dish also came with macaroons that were so-so. The cake itself was shaped like a small gift box and delicious, but there was one small hiccup. Being full from our meal, we asked our server if it could be stored in the kitchen fridge and be picked up later, when we were heading home. They did oblige us, but the dessert was accidentally thrown out. However, they did make us a new one, on the spot, without question. Jean-Georges is very upscale and elegant. It's one of those restaurants where it doesn't seem odd that different people come to serve you wine, bread, appetizers, entrees or dessert. The staff also has a neat system which they use to call the bussers over to clear a table - they simply place their hand on their left lapel. Classy! One thing that does mystify me about Jean-Georges - and Nougatine, for that matter, is their dress code. Both restaurants say no jeans, sneakers, etc, yet when I had dinner at Nougatine and lunch at Jean-Georges, I saw jeans and sneakers in both restaurants. Do they not enforce the dress code? So, what is preventing me from awarding a 5 star rating? Well, for anyone who saw the documentary \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi,\" it noted that a restaurant that has a 3 Michelin star rating is worthy of a trip to that city just to eat at the restaurant. While Jean-Georges was exceptional in terms of food, service and ambiance, I'm not sure that a trip to NYC is warranted for their lunch service. It's probably more likely that they receive three Michelin stars for their dinner service. Not to say that lunch was by any means bad - it was exceptional, but I wouldn't plan a trip to NYC just to eat here. After a 2 year hiatus, I came back to visit NYC, and no trip is complete without a fine dining trip to Jean-Georges. The menu had completely changed, the prices, ambience, service, quality, and uniqueness remained the 5 star experience it deserved. We ordered the summer tasting prefix menu, with nothing on the menu the same as it was 2 years ago for the winter tasting: Popcorn Miso Amousse shot with watermelon crest. Yes, popcorn miso. You'd think that was something a broke Japanese college student would eat for dinner. Nope, only Jean-Georges could come up with that. Tangy miso soup with popcorn in it. Ridiculous and extremely tasty. I will try to replicate and the uncultured will laugh. Strawberry foie gras with granola (best breakfast you'll ever eat they say). It had some wild nuts that I couldn't eat (allergic to wild nuts), but the girlfriend loved it for the texture, strawberries, granola, and other breakfast tastes mixed in. Scallop sashimi with matcha powder. They had a seared scallop dish that we should have tried. The sashimi was lacking in any flavor, but I have to admit it was adventurous with matcha powder (used typically in green tea) on top, along with some scallions. Also a great touch to lay the dish on top of a cool, flat, shiny sea shell out of the \"Little Mermaid.\" Skate (soft white fish) over a veggie medley. The only other time I had skate was in onion vinagrette two years ago here, and it was amazing. The fish was just as good this time around. Ridiculous how they make it so soft, without being mushy. The salad had a ton of unique peas, onions, croutons, artichoke and other veggies that worked. Refreshing. Parmesan crusted chicken - they somehow managed to crispy fry the top 10%. The rest of the chicken remained baked/seared/however they made it. Only a professional could pull this off, it's impossible for a commoner to do. It's so hard to explain. The crust was just amazing. Veal scallopini - the best dish of the lunch. The meat was OMG perfectly cooked, with a mix of 3 mushrooms on top in a perfect gravy/sauce. It was amazing. I normally don't even care for veal. The flavors were so good I wanted to lick my plate. Who am I kidding, I did when staff wasn't looking! The complimentary dessert was a plate of homemade marshmallows (so soft and fluffy, I could die!... get the reference?? hehehe), and 4 differing pieces of unique chocolate. The coconut bite was the best. Total for 5 dishes, w/free appetizer + dessert, only $120 post tip and tax. What a steal! If you're in NYC and don't eat at Jean George's French/AmAsian fusion (1 month reservation required, formal attire only), you're basically like a tourist who goes to Paris and doesn't see the Eiffel tower. Very classy. Another successful pairing of presentation with exquisite taste. I loved the ambience, the service, and everything that was served. Being a foie gras deprived California, I naturally swooped on everything that had foie gras. And man did that hit the spot. Don't get me started on that lobster...*still swooning* Let me start out with full disclosure, I am a major food snob so I definitely have much higher standards than most... I have eaten at the best restaurants all around the world from Paris to St. Tropez all the way to Miami to NYC, just read my other reviews. I was so excited to go to Jean-Georges this week, but quite disappointed after the dinner. The food is good but not exceptional or anywhere near the level expected for $200+ a person. At this price point I expect Bouley quality cuisine which is not what I experienced at Jean-Georges. I had the Tuna ribbon appetizer, which would have been excellent however the ginger infused sauce took away from it as the ginger overpowered the course. Unless you love ginger, I suggest requesting the sauce on the side to taste. Then I had the mushroom Risotto which was good but was way too heavy on the salt. I had to drink an entire glass of water afterwards. I noticed another reviewer mentioning having to drink two glasses of water after dinner, so it seems I am not alone in this experience. Finally, for the main course I had the lobster which was very tasty but the texture was much tougher than I have ever experienced at a similar level restaurant. I literally was sitting at the table wrestling with slicing it. The servers were looking at me at one point because they saw what a tough time I was having. On a positive note, the warm chocolate tart for desert was delicious and the most memorable part of the meal was the pretzel bread! I actually had two pieces it was so good. Another positive is they do give you a lot of food and extra's so you will be quite full at the end of your meal, especially after all that bread. Now if this dinner was half the cost, I would give it 4 stars considering the beautiful ambiance and exceptional service, but at this price point I expect an incredible meal which this was not. I was so looking forward to saying \"wow, that was amazing\" after each bite instead of \"wow, that was disappointing.\" I think I will stick to Bouley for the explosion of flavors in your mouth moments from here on forward. That is worth it, sadly, this is not. I may give Jean-Georges one more shot to see if this was just a one off poor experience and maybe the main chef was out... If I do, I will report back... You are simply tantalizingly us! The tuna tartare was sharp and totally mouth-watering. What comes next made us swoon - calamari, foie gras, salmon sashimi, incredible - a most memorable night - thank you! We came here for lunch, and it was definitely quite a steal for a 3 michelin star restaurant. Service was impeccable, decor was very bright, chic and modern (in contrast to Le Bernardin's). We got to sit at a booth side table at the corner of the main dining room, and had a good view of the whole restaurant. Was hoping to get a Donald Trump siting, but didn't happen ;)  They started us with bread & a trio of beautifully presented amuse bouche to tickle our taste buds. For my starter, I had the foie gras terrine, with slow-roasted strawberries and aged balsamic vinegar. The dish was great, but i felt the sweet/tartness of the strawberry overpowered the delicate/buttery taste of the foie gras. (I've actually made a mental note to myself to end this obsession with foie gras, as i know each kitchen prepares it differently, and I always end up dissapointed. You see, I was spoiled by the French Laundry, and now nothing will ever compare. Sigh.) For my entree, I had the Black Sea Bass encrusted with nuts & seeds on a bed of sweet and sour jus. It was beautifully presented, and i particularly loved the taste of the heirloom tomatoes. The bass was cooked perfectly. It was a light and refreshing dish, perfect for lunch.  The Mr. had the sea scallops with caramelized cauliflower in a caper-raisin emulsion to start. It was also beautifully presented and tasted just as good as it looked. For entree, he went with the parmesan crusted confit leg of chicken with a white asparagus, and lemon butter sauce. The dish was quite tasty and reminded me of a very upscale fried chicken. LOL. The sauce went perfect with the meat.  We debated on whether or not we wanted dessert as we were actually contently full, but decided to go with the chocolate dessert (you get a dual dessert tray btw) which consisted of the jean-george chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream and a caramelized honey ganache, amaranth seeds and a hibiscus streusel. And as if we haven't had enough, we were presented with an array of additional treats: Complimentary house-made marshmallows cut right there in front of you, lavender macarons, and finally a tray of chocolates. My fav was the macarons.  Overall, it was a great meal. With all the awesome restaurants to try in NYC, i wouldn't necessarily be too eager to come back. I would definitely recommend coming for lunch, as you get your bang for your buck for a 3 michelin star restaurant, but otherwise save your $$$ for Le Bernardin. I loved the dinner (pre fixe) went here with my bf family and it was really good. I especially liked the pan seared foie gras with lychee and chives. It was soo good. I also really liked the butter lobster with tapioca and passionfruit. My muscovy duck was great too, but I definitely couldn't finish it on my own so had to share with my bf. I was brought here for an anniversary dinner. The service of course, was impeccable. However, I woke up that night with a huge stomach ache.  While the food is delicious and the presentation perfect, the food is HEAVY on butter. I know it's french, but usually I don't go home in pain (unless I drink the butter sauce from my steak). I had the traditional tasting and the bf had the seasonal. I was glad I got the traditional. None of the dishes were really memorable except the caviar egg! If I were to go back, I would just have 5 of those for dinner. The lobster was good too, but you really can't (and shouldn't) go wrong with lobster. I had the chocolate plate in the end. As a big chocolate lover (I can't eat Godiva or anything packaged...not worth the calories), it was a pretty big disappointment. The little box of chocolate and the anniversary cake were delicious though! I thought it was a little strange how the difference between these two desserts was so substantial.  It's a good place to go for a special occasion, but a little too stuffy. I think we were the youngest people there. If I were to do it over again, I would probably do lunch there instead of dinner. By the time we got to the end of dinner, we had been eating for 3 hours and were exhausted. On a side note, at one point I had liver on my plate and gave some to my bf. He looked down and his dish had fava beans in it. Then he said if we had ordered a chianti...movie people will get this... Elegant dining at its best. Took my aunt here for Mother's Day. The last time hubby and I ate at Jean-Georges was pre-foam craze (never been a big fan of foam food which has thankfully died). Service was outstanding and our food was just amazing. The bottle of Puligny-Montrachet that one of the sommeliers helped us order was also fantastic. We had the 3-course prix-fixe menu and ate the following: yellowfin tuna ribbons, foie gras brule, diver scallops, crispy salmon, risotto with peekytoe crab, saute foie gras, black sea bass, duck breast and rack of lamb. For dessert, you chose by theme, i.e. chocolate, rhubarb, citrus or caramel. Since there were four of us, we got to try all four themes - they were all divine. The bill will put a huge hole in your wallet but the food and experience was well worth it. This is the first Michelin 3-star restaurant I have tried. It was perfect!  My husband and I went there for a Saturday lunch. Before we went there, we were told by my friends that the lunch menu is different from the lunch menu posted on their website and in fact the options are very limited. I believed that since my friends have been there a few times, and I was kinda nervous which menu I would get. Surprisingly we did get the same lunch menu as I saw on the website. Maybe my friends went there too late, or maybe we were lucky? I don't know. The service was excellent. The staff explained the dish in great details. This is the best service I have had from a restaurant.  We chose the $38 2-course lunch. The restaurant offered us some small appetizers to start with. The soup and the cucumber were good, and I liked the salmon a lot. We both started with the caviar, b/c we had never had that before. I got suckling pig for entree since I came for it, and indeed I loved it! My husband had tenderloin, and he said that's the best beef he had ever had. After that, we shared the chocolate-flavor dessert. I am not a chocolate fan, and I couldn't even finish the sample dessert that they provided as they were full of chocolate and were so sweet. However, I loved the all chocolate-flavor desserts. They were so good!  The bill came up to $200, since all of the courses we ordered required some $ supplement, but it doesn't matter. I loved everything we had. I am totally impressed. Although this is not a place that I can come everyday, I definitely want to come back to celebrate any big days. This review is for the lunch special, which I should say right off the bat is a pretty fantastic deal for a restaurant the calibre of Jean Georges. While I am generally a fan of the chef's various restaurants around the city, his eponymous flagship restaurant is really a cut apart. Starting with a glamorous location on Columbus circle, a total of 3 hostesses to great you, and a beautifully decorated dining room, this feels like a dining experience. Floor to ceiling windows ensure great lighting (though not much can be said for the views given the ground floor location). One complaint I had is that certain tables in the main dining room are set into mini cubby holes. Those tables themselves are cool and romantic, but they then place regular tables directly in front of them (which is where I happened to be seated). It made me feel uncomfortable and as pretty as my date was, I dont think the couple in the cubby behind would have been too thrilled to have my table completely blocking their view for their entire meal. Between the two of us we split 4 dishes (plates are priced at $19 each, starting with two for $38). The menu is split into 3 sections: cold appetizers, hot appetizers and more entree sized items. We had one each from the first two sections and 2 from the third, including sea urchin with jalapeno and yuzu, shrimp with saffron and chipotle, flounder with spaghetti squash and veal scallopine. I cant complain - everything pretty much hit the spot, though I'm not sure if anything really floored me with the \"wow\" factor. In spite of a very tempting looking dessert menu, my cheaper instincts kicked in and we decided to hold out for the free desserts that inevitably stamp the end of a meal at a place like this. We were not disappointed: homemade marshmallows, and a tray full of sweet treats definitely hit the spot. I'll be back for more... They have not skipped a beat. I had not been here in several years and they remain in my mind the number one fine dining experience in NYC. Always makes a trip to NYC special!! First of all, let me throw up in my mouth a lil... The traditional definition of \"fine dining\" is dead. What once meant a night out with your folks after graduation in your finest polyester blend dress is now a night out with good friends in a pair of ripped 200 dollar jeans. Fancy shmancy, uptight, staff with no personalities is now gone and have been replaced with hipsters that fear the chefs they work for. Unlike Monsieur Georgy whom probably doesn't step foot in his restaurants anymore. The \"blue hairs\" of yesteryears are dying off and restaurants such as Jean-Georges is not adapting to this modern concept. So here we are... The Man, The Chef, The Attorney and me... None of us besides the Chef consider ourselves food snobs... well... maybe a lil. After years of gluttonous eating and drinking, you kinda learn a thing or 2. Such as, the difference between chocolate and nutmeg. Confused? Ya... Me too. You see, by the end of our meal, I ordered an eggnog. Traditionally, eggnog is served with grated nutmeg. Mine came with shaved chocolate. Which to be honest, I didn't mind. I didn't really care till The Chef took a sip and thought it was strange. She asked the server if this was a mistake or some other twist to the cocktail. The no personality waitress couldn't answer and therefor had the bartender come out and speak with us. I really didn't want to make a fuss because I truly didn't mind the \"mistake\" but others in my group ordered the drink and preferred the traditional serving of nutmeg. Anyway, the shithead bartender argued that my drink was topped with nutmeg and not chocolate. \"Are you shittin me? You don't think I know the fucking difference between nutmeg and chocolate?! That's like telling me I don't know the difference between bourbon and gin. Get the f*ck outta here\". So, this fool instead of admitting his mistake made our group feel awkward and pissed off. Now here's the thing. You may ask yourselves, \"Is it fair to rate a restaurant 1 star because of a stupid mistake made by a bartender?\" No, of course not. I rate it on the whole experience. From the moment we walked in, till the moment we left, our usual pure enjoyment of dining out was replaced with a constrictive and boring atmosphere. The days of white tablecloths and stuffy settings have been replaced with flickering candles, shared plates and copious amounts of wine and laughter. The fine dining of our generation tastes better, looks better and is prepared by chefs who are focused more on the food and not by the jacket you're wearing. Now to the food... Half of us enjoyed their courses throughout and the other half was mediocre at best. For almost a thousand dollars per couple (and that's with NO wine pairing) I would've expected you to lick the whipped cream off my big toe while I sip on a \"PROPER\" drink. I'd like to take this time to thank Monsieur Georgy for my decision to never, ever dine in another \"traditional fine dining restaurant\" ever again. One of the best restaurants in New York. The food is spectacular, though their wine list by the glass is not long, the list by the bottle is extensive. My boss took me here for my birthday (no, I do not sleep with my boss), and while it was NY restaurant week, which attracted not the usual crowd, the service was excellent.  This is the type of restaurant you pick to impress your date. What's not to like? Small portions cooked and presented with absolute perfection. I will note that if you're not huge on trying new things, these types of restaurants may not be the place for you. Service was nice-- stiff, attentive, but fine. My fiance took me here to celebrate our engagement and they gave us an extra dessert with gold leaf and \"congratulations\" which was so nice. Don't let the portion size fool you.. you will be stuffed when you leave. A true dining experience. Plus, I'm pretty sure Tommy Hilfiger and some rockers who I didn't recognize because I'm young were at the bar. Win win. 4.5 stars Came here last summer for the lunch deal with my family to celebrate my parents' anniversary. 2 plates for $38 is a pretty great deal, especially with the extras. Service was great, polite but a bit restrained, and overall it was a memorable experience.  Started with an amuse bouche of uni on rye, carrot soup, and something else that's escaped my memory. Then came the bread and a creamy butter that was the highlight of the meal for me. I couldn't stop eating the bread just so I could have more of that butter!  I got the corn ravioli with basil fondue to start, which was easily my favorite dish of the meal. Cooked al-dente, the ravioli were bursting with cheese and firm corn kernels. I loved the creamy yet light basil sauce and mopped it up with my bread. I only wish there had been more than the 5-6 pieces. For my main, I had arctic char with chile oil. Fish was cooked great, but it didn't wow me. We added a $14 dessert (plum crumble with sweet corn ice cream), which was TINY and very disappointing. Couldn't really taste the sweet corn.  As it was my parents' anniversary, we got a chocolate mousse along with our marshmallows, chocolates, and cassis macaroons. To be honest, the mousse was better than the dessert I'd ordered.  I expected to be blown away but wasn't by this meal. Of everything I had, I'd only come back for the butter and the corn ravioli. What can I say about the greatness of Jean Georges that hasn't been said already? It had been on my \"must try\" list for literally 5 years and for whatever reason I just never made it there. But boy am I happy to say now I can cross it off my bucket list. Just a spectacular meal from start to finish. One of the top 3 all around dining experiences you'll have in New York city for sure. It's in the pantheon of legendary restaurants for a reason. For starts, the service is impeccable. It's everything you want and expect from this type of place. Along with EMP, probably the best service in NYC. I actually liked the service even more so here because it seemed more genuine and less recited than EMP. As much as I love EMP, the last time I was there it got kinda creepy with how they hear everything you and your dining companions are talking about. I suspected they had the table tapped, but thats a story for a different day.  The food obviously met my expectations. Just superb. Going in I planned on going with the tasting menu, but of course when looking at the season's three course menu, I was presented a bit of conundrum. The menu is a little different than online so be aware. So many incredible choices- did I want crispy suckling pig, rack of lamb, duck with foie gras and marcona almonds? Ugh, I was so torn. But being it was my first time I did the signature tasting and added in the caramelized foie gras for a supplemental charge of $25. So worth it!  Egg Caviar- Probably the one course I didn't care for only because I dislike caviar. I totally forgot this was the first course and it's probably not my fault for mentioning no caviar. But still, I put it to the side and thoroughly enjoyed the perfectly cooked semi scrambled egg and the whipped cream. Delicious, and others have definitely tried to immitate this. Sea Scallops Caramelized Cauliflower and Caper-Raisin Emulsion- Absolutely terrific. Scallops were perfectly cooked and placing the crispy cauliflower right on top eliminated the work in trying to get everything on one forkful. The sauce was just right- sweet and savory. Caramelized Foie Gras Black Olive Seasoning, Lychee and Brioche (ADDED)- Probably my favorite course of the night and I am happy I added it. A very generous portion of seared foie was accompanied by this black olive powder I had never seen anything like before. That provided some great saltiness, the lychee puree was great as well to add sweetness, and of course some toasted brioche was thrown in there as a classic pairing to sop up all those fatty juices. A total mindblower. Must order. Young Garlic Soup with Thyme and Sauted Frog Legs- Was thinking of subbing this for something else, but glad I didn't. A really innovative dish. The garlic soup was so creamy and had some earthiness from the thyme. But the frog legs make the dish. They are little crispy pieces of deliciousness that you dunk in the soup. Like little buffalo wings elevated. Turbot with Chteau Chalon Sauce- Wasn't head over heels for this. Fish was cooked nicely, but I felt like the sauce was way too heavy on the alcohol. Not sure if that's intended or the chef just didn't leave it on the fire long enough to let it cook out. Lobster Tartine with pea shoots- Jean Georges is a master with lobster. This dish was no exception. Broiled Squab Onion Compote, Corn Pancake with Foie Gras- The main reason I did the tasting. I love squab. And corn and foie. No way I wouldn't love this dish. Cooked nice and rareish on the inside as ordered. Nice half squab which had some Indian spices it seemed on it which I usually don't love but it worked well. Best part of the dish may have been to corn pancake with foie gras. Terrific. A great last savory course. Chocolate Dessert Tasting- You know this was good. 4 different preps that change. All delicious. I found myself creating my own combos. A little panna cotta dipped in my white chocolate ice cream. A little of this a little of that. Even the ubiquitious \"molten lava cake\" which actually didn't seem played out here. Oh and here is an insider tip that I discovered while playing with dessert flavors... Take a spoonful of chocolate cake and some of the home made marshmallows, some vanilla ice cream.. HOLY SHIT. SMORES from heaven!! Your welcome. We celebrated a birthday here with six people and all ordered the Prix Fixe.  Naturally almost everything was great - but here are the stand outs: Part 1: Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons with Avocado and a Ginger Marinade. Light & delicious.  Part 2: Carmelized Fois Gras with Black Olive Seasoning, Lychee and Brioche. Heaven. So rich I would order this for my last meal. Part 3: Crispy Confit of Suckling Pig. Earthy with a kick of Jalapeno. Perfection. Dessert: Both the Chocolate Tasting and the Rhubarb Tasting are excellent. All except the dessert can be made gluten & dairy free if you are on a cleanse. My perennial favorite in NYC for fine dining, Perfect execution of menu items. The foie gras creme brle is legend.I order it every time. I've eaten here a dozen or so times since it opened (2002, I think?). When choosing a fine place to dine before leaving NYC, this is the spot we picked. The creativity, food, environs, service are all impeccable. This place will always hold a special place in my heart, and belly. :) When I spend the equivalent of international airfare for a two person meal, I expect to be transported to an amazing place by the food, but this was not the case. It was solid, but nothing impressed. The service was excellent, the place is beautiful and very romantic and a great way to impress or unwind. If you have hundreds of dollars to throw away. Go for the scene, not the food. When I heard that Jean-Georges offered a pre-fixe lunch for $38, I called my boyfriend and harrassed him until he made us a reservation for our NYC trip. I had never eaten in a Michelin star restaurant before and wasn't about to pass up the opportunity. The environment was very business-y. I kept making eye contact with women and men in suits and felt really out of place in my cheetah print blouse. They also seated my boyfriend and I on the same side of a booth table so we were just staring at other tables while eating and that was kind of awkward.  I loved their ginger drink and ordered like 3 of them. Overall the food was good, portions were bigger than I expected (especially after having dined at Eleven Madison Park) and definitely worth the price. I left stuffed and content. But their homemade marshmellows tasted like nothing. Just putting that out there. This review is only base on their customer service. I and my boyfriend had prefixed lunch on my birthday. For appetizer my boyfriend had tuna tartar. The last bite he had of the dish, he chewed something very hard, almost hurt his gum and teeth. It was very small plastic-like piece. We told our bartender(we sit at the bar) and general assistance manager came to us and said \"it does look like a scale from tuna....\" and continue to make excuses.  First, i get upset that the manager mention any apology till i said fish scale cannot be hard like this and it is more shiny then the plastic piece. Secondly, since the size of tuna is huge, even sushi restaurants(fish-focused-restaurants) do not use whole tuna. I used to work as manager at high-end sushi restaurant for years. It's almost impossible to have tuna scale inside of tuna tartar. Tuna scale is thiner and shiner. All of us can make mistake and i wanted to let them know to prevent same accident on other customer. But the manager treated us disrespectfully. Bad customer service. In the future i will never go Jean George for any occasion. My first visit to a Michelin star-rated restaurant disappointed, but only slightly. I wanted my lunch at Jean-Georges to be a transcendent dining experience, and in many ways it was, but the meal as a whole wasn't perfect. I'd simply be trying to justify the amount of money I paid if I gave it five stars. I could try to fool myself, but what's the point? Let's start with the highlights. If Jean Georges did one thing I never thought possible, it was make me like rye bread. The sweetened rye was impeccable, and I must have asked the bread person (I'm sure she has a proper name) for numerous helpings without her batting an eye (you really can't take me anywhere). The trio of amuse bouche that followed was a lovely, delicate touch, the highlight being a chilled watercress soup. My dining companion and I agreed that our meal peaked with the foie gras, an innovative variation on the classic terrine, topped with crunchy, sour cherry soaked granola and an aged strawberry balsamic drizzle. I'd say without hesitation that it was the best foie I've ever had. The rest of our dishes, unfortunately, failed to leave their mark on our palates (although certain aspects, including a delicious, if slightly anemic caramel dessert sampling, and a fun assortment of petit fours, did manage to impress). The goat cheese gnocchi were far too rich (I felt my arteries clog after one bite), and the crispy crab, served tackily (although some might say whimsically) as a fish stick, was simply underwhelming. Entrees were better, although my friend's veal scallopine recalled a generic masala dish, and my sweetbreads, while delicious, were served with a side of maitake mushrooms that tasted vaguely of dirt. Service was exemplary as you would expect, but I was most impressed with the general down-to-earthness of the majority of servers. Take, for example, our principal waiter, who responded to our request to switch tables thusly: \"Of course, but it's going to cost you your first-born child.\" Completely dead pan. I love it. Who says three Michelin stars can't be fun? Maybe I'm just a lowbrow bumpkin consumer, but I just simply did not understand why anyone would rave about this place. I did not appreciate the overtly stuffy, elitist vibe, which presented itself from every angle -- the other patrons in the restaurant, the snooty waitress and host, the ambiance devoid of any charm, any chatter/buzz or even the slightest musical tones, and the obnoxious overcharging. It was as sterile a restaurant experience as I ever had.  The food was boring and lacked any genuine spirit. It was memorable only for being underwhelming - nothing was particularly tasty, appealing or satisfying. The dishes featured too much sauce and dressing, compared to actual substance. I also felt like most of the warm/hot plates were actually lukewarm -- maybe this is deliberate, but it made the food much less appealing to me. I left hungry and annoyed. And I've been to plenty of restaurants that are on the expensive end, so it must have been more than that.  This place overall just made me feel like I was living in 1985, or like I was in an American Psycho scene that was mocking the self-righteous air about it. These days, with the amazing developments in the New York restaurant scene, I see no need to go back in time and be price-gouged for the sake of it. Amazing. One of the best dining experiences ever. Here is what you should order: - Tuna - Corn ravioli - chicken - seabass You will walk away on clouds. Very accommodating .. lovely place and service The fish tasted like everybody eles fish so I would not order fish here again. However the mayo dipping sauce and calamari was to die for. The rice was perfect and like aldente pasta; perfect texture for me; not starchy at all. The bowel artful -and ginger rice simply delicious. Service was elegant. I liove the beige colors in this trump building resturant right across from central park. I feel like a douche giving 3 Yelp stars to a an establishment with 3 Michelin stars, but I personally much preferred my meal at Le Bernardin and at other lesser and non-Michelin starred restaurants, for that matter. I ordered the Arctic char per the waitress's strong recommendation, and while the fish was cooked and presented beautifully, the dish was over-salted to the point of inedibility. The fish itself was fine if a little lacking in \"wow\" factor, but the \"jade\" emulsion the fish came bathed in tasted of nothing aside from salt, and the white asparagus were frankly so salty that I was forced to spit my bite back out onto the plate. Fortunately, I was able to have the dish sent back to the kitchen and replaced with the black sea bass in a smooth and completely painless fashion, but unfortunately, that dish was completely unmemorable. However, I did enjoy my sea scallops, and the nicely caramelized cauliflower slices neatly perched atop each scallop were an unexpected and creative touch. The rhubarb dessert was nice enough and managed to pack a lot of flavor into such a tiny serving. My favorite part of the meal, hands down, was the platter of chocolates and mignardises served after dessert. The crunchy little cluster of lavender and white chocolate ended what was a pretty disappointing lunch on a high note. Also, the ambience is nice -- dining room is bright, clean, white, fresh, and airy. I was soooooo RIDICULOUSLY excited for this meal!! I had made the Open Table reservation for my husband and myself a couple of weeks earlier and was counting down the days! 8:45 was the earliest time available (which was \"so normal\" according to an NYC-dwelling friend), so we showed up, hungry and excited and ready to celebrate our one month of being married :) :) :) We went with the 3-course price fix menu, which consists of an amuse bouche, 3 dinner courses, a dessert tasting course, more little sweet snacks, and to-go chocolates for the ladies (sexist? whatever, as long as I get the goods). For $98 at a 3-star Michelin restaurant, this was incredible!! And cocktails were surprisingly reasonably priced, with lots of options in the $15-ish range. Amuse bouche: watermelon with chili & lime, cucumber with fresh dill, and a shot of corn and popcorn soup. My dinner courses: yellowfin tuna ribbons with avocado, spicy radish, and soy-ginger sauce; charred corn ravioli with tomatoes, greens, and corn kernels; nut and seed crusted sea bass with tomatoes, spring onions, and potatoes. Hubby's dinner courses: foie gras brulee with strawberries and balsamic vinegar; steamed snapper with artichoke hearts and black bean vinaigrette; beef tenderloin with squash. Dessert courses: I chose the chocolate theme and hubby chose the cherry theme. And we were each given a plate with FOUR desserts on it. It was insane. I LOVE YOU JOHNNY IUZZINI!! The highlights? I seriously can only pinpoint \"EVERYTHING.\" We were legitimately blown away by EVERY part of our meal and each dish was the best _____ we'd ever had. Soothing textures, delicious flavors, the works. And the service was just ridiculous, in a good way. Our glasses were never empty, the courses were timed perfectly, and bread was practically thrown at us between each course.  We definitely couldn't finish our dessert courses, as amazing as they were...and our post-dessert snacks included lavender macarons, vanilla marshmallows, and chocolates. I was disgustingly full but ate ALL of the vanilla marshmallows...they were so good, and I've been longing for them since leaving New York. Five stars doesn't do our experience justice...this place is just on another level, hence the three Michelin stars. Loved loved loved it!! And I plan to be back the next time we're in NYC...though my hubby doesn't know it yet :D Maybe I had a mediocre lunch because they save the Kitchen A-Team for dinner. The service was great, the decor was fine, and they even packed us a complimentary doggy bag of chocolates after I mentioned I liked a certain flavor. That being said, the food left something to be desired for a 3 Michelin star restaurant. The dishes themselves are underwhelming, ordinary, and slightly too salty. I can't complain too much, since their 2 course lunch is only $39 and it comes with amuse bouche and petit-fours. A good deal if you have someone to impress and not too much cash. As I was leaving Jean Georges last night I realized that I'd just had one of the best meals of my life.  The food, service and ambiance were all subtly fantastic. Every course was delicious without a misstep. nothing more to say than what's already been said. i definitely am not a person who can afford to eat at three star michellin restaurant but their lunch pre-fixe of $38 dollars person makes it very reasonable. You get the two dishes that you get, plus the amuse bouche and the desserts(homemade marshmallows, chocolate pieces and mini macaroons). ive taken many of my friends here and they loved the experience and the food of course! definitely one of the FAVORITE restaurants in new york city! Wake up, wake up...I gotta write this review, but every attempt I make I find myself getting sleepy cause it was just so f*cking boring, underwhelming, stifling, aggh!!!   Visiting NY from the other coast with Jackie Chan, The Architect and of course, my Beloved Attorney , we planned our trip around food, basically, with all dinners for the week reserved before we left...it's how we roll. As it happened, Jean-Georges fell on the last night of our trip. The Architect dubbed it 'Prom Night'.  All dolled up, we looked hot! We were hungry. We were attempting to conclude the past 6 nights of gastronomic debauchery with, what we thought was, the Grande Dame of cuisine in NYC.  The restaurant itself was fine; elegant, spacious, and comfortable...but it felt like the livingroom at your grandparent's house that no one ever sat in. No warmth. Our server was void of personality. Again, no warmth. And the food: We opted for the pick your own Prix Fixe menu. Some of the options chosen amongst us were delicious. Some were boring, namely, the scallops - it read as a tartar, but came thinly sliced and seared...cooked basically and in a very savory sauce, overall, it was heavy and not worth it. The fois gras was delicious and so lovely to have as it's banned in our home state. Overall, the food was good...but nothing was wow. Nothing was out of the ordinary or inspiring. Absolutely everything felt tried and true. (Yawn) And....Marshmallows? Really? Really? You're still doing marshmallows? How Y2K of you Jean-Georges! Anyway, marshmallows are cute, fun, and whimsical. I couldn't think of a more antithetical food for Jean-Georges. It just felt so out of place. Like Queen Elizabeth in a dunk tank.  Perhaps our expectations were too high? Perhaps we just had too much damn good food prior to this 'prom'? Perhaps we had too much boisterous laughter, pounding on the tables, jokes with our servers, elbows on the linens...ergo, the sterile, sober and perfectly beige evening at Jean-Georges just left a lackluster and dull impression on us. Based on the above review I would think a 3 star would be appropriate, but here's what really killed it for me: Jackie Chan ordered a glass of eggnog, while the rest of us ate the desserts, which were frankly unmemorable. So, Jackie Chan liked her nog, but I was less than impressed. When I tasted it, it was missing the flavor that IS eggnog - NUTMEG. There was no nutmeg. There WAS however, shaved chocolate on top. I thought it a little nontraditional and out of place, but whatever. Not meeting my expectations for eggnog, I passed and didn't order one. The Architect and my Beloved did order one each. Low and behold, these two came with grated nutmeg on top....sans chocolat! So, I tasted this one and bada-bing-bada-boom, we have eggnog people!!!! I then ordered one and asked the server why the first one had chocolate and these had nutmeg. She looked at me like I just ordered a Big Mac and told me it always has nutmeg. We all gasped and showed her the remaining chocolate shavings in the glass. Unimpressed, she walked away and sent the bartender over...the bartender who apparently made said eggnog with chocolate shavings and who proceeded to tell us it wasn't chocolate but nutmeg - undertone- you f*cking plebeian idiots what do you know about nutmeg anyway! He wouldn't hear of it. In his mind, we were fools. I guess nutmeg melts between the fingers of fools? This incident, in tandem with the rest of the overall mundane experience, marred the evening. Sad to say the best part of the night was when our server's helper bee dropped a silver dome lid removed from one of our entres. It made such a loud noise. It was so deafening against the quiet dullness of the room.  Why was that the best part? It was most human and genuine thing displayed by the wait staff all night. Came in this year for our usual anniversary dinner and was a bit disappointed by both the food AND the service. While of course compared to \"average\" restaurants the food and service were spectacular, however JG is no \"average\" restaurant and I expect better...especially since I know and HAVE experienced better at JG last year! Service: we ordered a bottle of wine, every time the lady poured, she spilled drops of wine either on the table or down the side of the bottle. The concept of turning the bottle to prevent spills was apparently not taught to her. Half way through the meal, our waiter was apparently too busy to tell us about our meal and the boy who cleared our plates came over to tell us about our dish and what was presented to us. Meal: Hubby and I both had the tasting menu, he went with traditional and I chose summer. The only stand out dish was the squab from the traditional menu. They served a pre-dinner sorbet and gazpacho, which were both awful, I didn't even finish mine. The egg dish with caviar was delish but not mind blowing...but I would still have it again. The rest of the courses just melted together, and nothing stood out as amazing or spectacularly creative.  The lobster dish was however pretty awful, both the hubby and mine's lobster were tough and flavorless. Mine from the summer menu came with this awful chipotle sauce that was over powering and I didn't even both to use it on my lobster. Bottom line, I really hope this anniversary was just a fluke and that next year will be better. I would hate to have to change our tradition of going to jean georges for our anniversary. Excellent service I ever had before. Very spaceful place for date and business. The dishes are excellent that I am sure you will love it. Even the dessert, coffee, cheese, tea are so delicious. 999th review. And it is a 3.5'er! (okay just about a 4) Very hard to rate this restaurant as everything deserves a separate star rating, so I will do so below. Service - 5 stars. I am forgetting our waiter's name now - Dan or Dave- he was simply the best! Ambiance - nice. I recommend requesting quiet booth- you are tucked away in a totally private booth apart from all the other tables. Drinks: of course $$$ but good. Loved their house made ginger and lemon soda. Bread: plenty of it keeps coming to your table. Pretzel bread was too hard/not soft or doughy enough and pretty blah. The bread with the nuts and seeds inside was slightly sweet and delicious. A restaurant like this needs to use better quality butter though. Apps: I had THE best appetizer of my life here. The tuna ribbons with avocado and ginger sauce. Multiply the best ginger dressing you've ever had by a thousand and that was this one. The tuna was fresh and total perfection. I would go back only to order this one dish.  Off the chart # of stars! The scallops and cauliflower.  Never had thin scallops that were pounded down flat before. This took away from the texture and flavor scallops should have -- the cauliflower pieces on top were charred and mostly the scallops tasted like the grilled/charred cauliflower.  3 stars for this app. 2nd courses: Halibut. Simply prepared and perfectly fresh and delicious. 5 stars Arctic char -- nice sized portion. Very good. 4.5 stars 3rd courses:  Suckling pig -- sort of a letdown. The sauce it came with had a very unique flavor, not sure if I was a fan of it. I tried one forkful of bf's dish and wasn't too impressed. He agreed the pork itself was not tender enough or juicy.  Expected this dish to be a lot better than it was.  Barely 3 stars.  My mistake: Parmesan crusted chicken with artichokes I should have ordered the lobster! I wasn't crazy about most of the 3rd course options and I never order chicken in restaurants because I always make it at home.    Was disappointed to see this was a basic chicken cutlet. It wasn't super tender or tasty and the crunch parm coating wasn't too great.  After having 2 pieces I noticed it was pink in the middle. Clearly under cooked. So I had to send it back.  Waiter was super apologetic and they gave me a brand new dish 20 minutes later. I had to about force myself to finish the cutlet. I'm sure they cooked it too long this time and it was dry. Making it taste even worse. The sauce was too heavy but tasty and the slices of artichokes were good. But this chicken I could have made better at home, and for a restaurant of this level and price point, I give it ONE star (for the artichokes) Dessert: We were given extra here due to the chicken fiasco. Think we had about 4 plates of everything from citrus, to caramel to chocolate desserts plus they give you 2 chocolates to bring home.  Was not wowed by the desserts except for one: the chocolate lava cake. Small but the most delicious one I've ever had. They should serve that lava cake as a full plate dessert option. Pros: Not your tiny portion type of place. We were both surprised how large the portions were and how this was the first 5 star restaurant we actually left feeling way too full. Cons: That chicken. I spent the next day feeling sick. Just glad I sent it back and didn't eat the whole thing. From the look on my bf's face after he got the bill, and the fact this is a 3 * Michelin, really should not have received a dish that needed to go back. I was determined to go to a 3 Star Michelin restaurant in NY, as there is none near where I live. And Jean-Georges did not disappoint. Eating here is like going to watch a theater show. My boyfriend and I were seated next to each other facing the dining hall. When food came, it was under a dome and opened with a flourish while the waiters explained the dish. To get attention from the waiters, all I had to do was look over at a waiter, and they were over at my table in seconds. And the food! Wow! We ended up getting more food that we had planned just because the food was so creative and fun to eat. We got the tuna ribbons, sea trout in trout eggs, and sea scallops to start--all amazing dishes with my favorite being the tuna ribbons.  For the main course we got the Parmesan crusted chicken and the arctic char. The arctic char was delicious and light with its flavors and the chicken was amazing and was on top of a nice bed of artichoke. Everything here was just so good, you really couldn't go wrong. We also got complimentary dessert as it was my boyfriend's birthday, and we tried the rock fruit dessert tasting which was also delicious but a small portion. Overall, my experience here did not disappoint. The dishes here were definitely the best I've ever had and the ambiance and service were on point. I am definitely coming back here next time I'm in town. We came here for Sunday lunch, and both of us dressed up. I don't think their dress code is strict for lunch, as my boyfriend wore a suit and tie and felt overdressed. Awesome!  Went with my boyfriend for lunch hours. Yellowfish Tuna Ribbons is a must.. Service was good and servers had great attitude. They all had thick french accent but overall I would highly recommend this place. Free dessert at the end of the meal is awesome too ( marshmallow is so good)~~~ Wow! I have to say it again .. Wow! The food ~ spectacular (as one would expect from a three michelin star restaurant) .. service ~ impeccable, and ambiance ~ intimate, yet sophisticated.  I have a feeling you can't go wrong with whatever you choose at Jean Georges but my favorites were .. the Sea Scallops with Caramelized Cauliflower and the Soft Shell Crab. Mom loved the Sweet Pea soup and said that it was the best she had ever had.  And that gigantic dessert \"sampler\" .. each guest gets to choose a flavor, Chocolate, Caramel, or Citrus .. and they bring a huge plate with 4 different nice-sized portions of that flavor for each person. It's hardly what I would classify as a \"sampler\" lol. On top of that you also get a plate of petit fours and a slice of the house-made vanilla bean marshmallow. Needless to say we were all happily stuffed to the brim at the conclusion of the evening. It was an excellent meal and we will most certainly be back next time we are in NYC! Hands down the best French restaurant in NYC. Elegant dining room and superior service. Signature chocolate molten cake is a must! Jean George is often on-site. Food is consistently stellar. Slow cooked salmon is outstanding. Tasting menu is a must do. Came here for lunch on a Sunday. I am a fan. Presentation is quite exquisite and there was a lot of natural light coming in, which I liked as well. We were initially seated for two at a table where you sit side by side with your plus one. I knew I wouldn't enjoy my experience so I asked to move and they seated us at another table. I ordered the tuna ribbons and black sea bass.  Would go back and order the same thing again. I dined here with hubby and 5 friends for lunch before our flight back to LA a few weeks ago. I was not impressed when we first got there as the hostesses just seemed so snooty. They didn't even ask us to take our coats. Yet some other (obviously flashy about their wealth) folks walked in and first thing they do is take their coats while we are still waiting in the hotel lobby all wearing our winter gear. STRIKE ONE. We had dined at EMP a few days before and the service was much better. First impressions do count. The price for lunch is very reasonable so I'll give them that and the atmosphere was gorgeous. As for the food - it was good, but nothing that blew my mind. Overall, an okay experience. $29 two course lunch is an absolute STEAL. The quality of food here is astounding - it really is an art, beautiful art. Just be sure to call and make reservations ahead, because this place is booked. I was lucky to hitch on to a reservation made a month in advance. Boy, was I lucky! I ordered the fois gras brulee and the beef medallion. The fois gras brulee is a glorious melding of flavors and textures. You have the sweetness of the strawberry paired with the salty fois gras - then the crispy brulee paired with the creamy delicate liver. I was in food ecstasy. My friend aptly stated, \"it's a party in my mouth!\" The beef medallion was cooked perfectly and the sauce was unique. You pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I sampled my friends plates and it was all great. This is the kind of place you want to come to when your mouth is due for a treat. Your taste buds will thank you and then beg you to return. Jean-Georges is one of only seven Michelin 3-star restaurants in New York. And while there are disagreements over some of the Michelin 1- and 2-star ratings, I've not encountered serious issues with any of the three-stars. Which suggests that, without trying to impute dishonest motives to a few Yelpers, some of the reviewers of this restaurant have lacked the knowledge and sophistication required to enjoy dining at this level. And yes, we're sorry that sounds so pompous, but please readers, this ia one of the finest restaurants in the world, and our experience here recently confirmed that, The food, presentation, atmosphere and service were exemplary. Not that this tiny commentary adds anything new to what has already been written by so many before us, but it should be said again that it doesn't get better than this, in our dining experience. We chose the three-course price fixe (which includes dessert as the fourth course), and the four of us dined on a variety of dishes. The highlights were ... well, everything. Whether the amazing, ocean-fresh Sea Urchin or the subtly flavored Tuna Ribbons, the seafood choices were wonderfully taste appealing. Maine Lobster, carved our of its shell and ever-so lightly seasoned, was delicious, and the Wagyu Beef was succulent, tender and fully flavored and balanced with a piquant sauce. We ordered a 2009 Bordeaux on the sommelier's suggestion that was perfectly matched to our dining; the wine list is not exhaustive but carefully chosen and with the highest quality wines available. Desserts are chosen by category rather than dish. We selected the chocolate (four separate pieces) and winter and marveled at the exquisite creations of the pastry chef (who provided in addition a small plate of chocolate and miscellaneous confections, among them hand-made marshmellows). And then there was the service. Attentive and never obtrusive, the staff looked after our every need quickly and efficiently, knowing precisely when to leave us alone. The delivery of dishes was smooth and carefully paced. And there were numerous nice touches from everyone who took care of us. This is a highly trained and knowledgeable staff, to put it mildly. If Michelin gave four stars, the staff here would deserve it.  And yes, there is a price to be paid for this luxurious experience, but it needn't be exorbitant. The three-course price fixe is $118 at dinner with small supplements for the lobster and beef. You can find reasonably priced wines. It is expensive, but it's far from the most expensive establishment you can visit -- or, if you prefer, you can turn it into an even more pricey experience by adding a la carte and wines or cocktails. But whatever you do, you must come for a wonderful, memorable night out we're betting you'll remember for a long time. . Let me start off by saying that I want to give them 3.5 stars if that was an option, but because I think Jean-Georges is over-rated, I am skewing towards the lower end. I have no complaints about the service or the decor. In general, the major downfall for me was the food - it was rather disappointing. Don't get me wrong, the food was still enjoyable, but I expected more given the hefty price tag.  Another minor annoyance was the menu. For the dinner menu, the left side (prix fixe menu, 3 courses) and the right side (Jean-Georges and Summer menu, 7 courses each) have different numbers of courses. Guests in the same table must order from the same side of the menu, because otherwise, those with less courses would have empty plates while others eat. Note that this is a requirement, not just a friendly suggestion. I got the Prix Fixe meal and ordered (1) the Santa Barbara Sea Urchin, (2) the Caramelized Foie Gras, and (3) Duck Breast. The sea urchin appetizer was by far my favorite. The 4 pieces of sea urchin sat on top of crunchy bread and blended perfectly with the citus notes from the yuzu sauce. The sea urchin itself was fresh and creamy. They served a surprisingly big portion of the foie gras. The dish was delicious initially, because the foie gras was crisp on the outside and very tender inside. However, the fattiness of the foie gras really got to me half way through, and I wished they had something lighter on the plate to off-set its heaviness. The duck breast was my least favorite. The duck was cooked more than I would have liked. And the almond crusting on top was way too sweet. My favorite part of this dish was the potatos, which says something about how much I disliked the rest of the dish.  Although I appreciate their freebies (mini-appetizers, free dessert/candy, and small boxed-chocoloate), I highly doubt I would ever return. For what I spent, I could have gotten several very good meals elsewhere. There's not much more I can add to the 5-star reviews, except to say that this is the best meal I've had in NYC (and I've lived here 6-1/2 years).  My husband and I went for lunch and had the two-course meal for $38. It was more than enough food, but we also each had dessert. And free-flowing bread (what's not to like about that?). He started with the pea soup -- absolutely divine -- and I had the tuna ribbons, which were delectable. I wanted to drink the marinade. I then had the black sea bass, which was succulent, tender and delicious. The vegetables in the broth were also flavorful. My husband had the snapper, which was cooked to perfection. One of the highlights for me was the amuse bouche selection to start, especially the strawberry drink with wasabi foam -- loved it. I also enjoyed my passionfruit/lime soda with chili flakes. I might try duplicating that at home. Dessert was stupendous, with my husband ordering the caramel selection of desserts while I chose the chocolate. The molten chocolate cake was particularly good, while my husband really liked a layered dessert that he had (forgot what it was called).  They also served us a small plate of chocolates and tiny macarons, plus an orange marmalade-like jelly square (hard to describe), which I loved. And the marshmallows, as others have mentioned, completed the meal. Expensive for lunch, of course. But I will find another special occasion this year to go back, for sure. The service alone is worth the price of admission. They were attentive but not obnoxious, they checked in with us a couple of times to see if we were happy with the food, they refilled our drink glasses, and they didn't rush us. I couldn't have asked for better service. Came here on date night on a cold February evening. I was super underwhelmed by the food. There were some seafood highlights (lobster with parsnip puree and olive reduction; lamb with crispy polenta and sherry sauce, caviar with egg yolks and toast), but for the most part the food looked really exciting, but fell a tad flat of a High-C.  The tasting menus (chef's menu and winter menu) were rife with seafood dishes, and during most of them I kept wondering to myself why Jean Georges would serve lots of seafood dishes - doesn't he know he can't compete with Le Bernardin?  Wine pairings were superb. Ambiance was nice and a tad-under stuffy just how I like it. Super intimate. And waitstaff was very competent as one would expect. A wonderful meal with fabulous service. The autumn tasting menu is clever, relatively low calorie, and very tasty. We had the spring tasting menu earlier this year. The price is relatively steep but this is a very special place. We cook with four of his cookbooks. We had our first group lunch since arriving in New York at the only place where we made reservations for during our trip planning stages. They couldn't seat all nine of us together, so we split up in groups of six and three.  The Tastes of Fall menu allowed us to choose two entrees for $32, so I ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and the caramelized hanger steak with roasted brussel sprouts, pecans, and avocado. Everything was fantastic, particularly the steak and the brussel sprouts. Who would've known that brussel sprouts, the stereotypical dreaded vegetable from every kid's childhood, would be so good?  Our meal also ended with some complimentary desserts -- mini macaroons, chocolate, marshmallows and some other fruity desserts we couldn't identify. The macaroons were yummy and we took turns guessing what each item was, picking each small dessert item, trying it and announcing what the item actually was. It's a nice touch to the end of a very filling lunch.  This is definitely a fancy place where the patrons tend to be on the dressier side, even for lunch. We came in slightly casual wear and stood out a bit compared to the rest. Despite that minor detail, I wouldn't mind coming back for another meal! Compared to other 1 or 2 starred places I've tried, lunch at Jean Georges was underwhelming.  First off, service was not up to the standard of a 3 starred place. We called to let them know that we would be 10 minutes late; the lady on the phone simply explained their 15 minute grace period without taking note of my name. 1 minute later, I get a call asking me if we would be coming.  The lady who took our order and explained the dishes was polite but seemed a bit nervous, as if she was performing a school recital. The rest of the staff were not that great either: one waiter asked my friend to move her plate quite bluntly. We are not snobby people but we expected better here. The dining space is indeed beautiful, and the atmosphere from diners was casual but this was juxtaposed against an air of condescension from some of the staff.  Secondly, attention to detail is the expected icing on the cake when you dine at a Michelin restaurant. Unfortunately the amuse bouche did not impress, and the bread wasn't fresh. Our bread plates were taken away before the first course even arrived. When you compare it to something like the onion and bacon brioche at the Ledbury, it starts to look rather dismal.  Lastly, the food was not mind blowing. Perhaps the seasonal menu (\"tastes of summer\") was just not on par with their normal menu. You begin to understand why the lunch menu is only $38 when the starter is served and you finish it off in about 3 bites. The beef tenderloin gave me mixed feelings: the miso butter sauce was pleasantly complex (it tasted like a walk in the park) but it overpowered the taste of the tender meat. In general, the dishes were slightly unbalanced, with ingredients like yuzu, strawberries and lime oil tipping the dishes towards the tart end of the spectrum. I think they went a bit overboard with the summery aspect. You can easily rack up the price when you order dishes that require a supplement, add another dish for $19 or order dessert afterwards. I happened to do all 3 and ended up paying just over $100 in total for one person. When you charge this price you need to deliver, and deliver they did not! Considering I had just been to the NoMad for dinner 2 days beforehand and was completely satisfied whilst paying less, I can only say that there are definitely better options. If you haven't fine dined before you may be wowed, but if you've been to other more worthy establishments you may be left with a bitter aftertaste. I had the Spring tasting menu and my wife had the Jean-Georges menu. Both were even more amazing than you would expect. The wine pairings couldn't have been more perfect and the cocktails were great too. This was one of those game changing dining experiences. Take out a second mortgage and go! The food was great... but did not blow me away like I expected. The service is very good... But I felt the place was too stuffy and pretentious for my taste.. The dishes were pretty creative and everything looked and tasted great. I had the shrimp and uni.. the uni was hot and i think a hot or warm temp takes away from raw seafood in general. I also had the sea bass which had the best crust I have probably ever had on a cooked fish,. and the sauce was pretty awesome. I enjoyed the food but considering the price and the atmosphere I don't think I would go back.. Nice to try one though. 37th b day lunch w wifey. if u want true michelin 3star ecxp. this is not the place. le cirque. michelin star 1 is 3x better. 1 tasting menu n 2 entree. bill came out $ 400 for 2 at lunch. 400.yes. too much fusion touch away from french originality.. overrated. overpriced.hyped. jean georges.. i should try next 3 star place.. per se. In a league of its own...the location is special, friendly to nin hotel guests or big shots..and one of my usual places for NYC power breakfast. I get there about opening time, which on weekends, in the front part, is 8 am. The staff is attentive , but tends to give you a bit too much space at times.  At night the bar is warm and spotless. There is no tv, so if you hope to catch the Yankees game, you will need to zip back to your suite. Dinner at jean George's is an event. The specials reflect careful thought and a well grounded use of local, regional fresh ingredients. It is expensive. It is fantastic. You can opt for the more casual Nougatine, front room, if the Amex black card is at the breaking point. That's a very awesome place. Expensive but reasonable. I would like to eat it agin, but only in some special day. Before I go into why I only gave it 4 stars, let me tell you what's so great about it: almost everything. The slew of hosts, wait staff and servers were very nice, courteous and attentive. I loved the tentacled chandelier, the modern look, the comfy couches and the high ceiling. The ambiance was not pretentious, which was surprising.  I had the pre fixe: the sea urchin, caramelized foie and confit suckling pig. The foie was amazing. It's hard to go wrong with foie, though I've experienced that before. At Jean Georges, they know how to prepare it. Tender, flavorful, not overly oily and a good sized portion. I was full by the time the suckling pig came but that was still great. The slab of pork had a crisp skin and moist meat, and the sweet pea puree and marmalade/slaw (sorry, I can't remember exactly what it was so I may be butchering this side) was a great balance to the whole dish. And the side had bacon. Genius. It would have been great had they sliced it for me or at least gave me a real knife to cut it, but the flavor was great. Tasty and very filling. I had the citrus dessert, which was a very refreshing, and tart, finish. If you don't like tart, don't do citrus. I loved it. Cocktails were delicious. The only negative part, and it's a biggie, was the sea urchin. It came with a thin slice of jalapeno, with Yuzu sauce drizzled on top, all on black bread. I was excited for this. This was the reason I chose the pre fixe. The portion was fine but they overdid it with the sauce. It wasn't a drizzle, and tasted more like a slather. It was too overpowering and completely coated the sea urchin, masking its rich flavor. The sauce itself isn't bad and it didn't need to have so much of it. A small drip on top, perhaps even a side dip on the plate, would have been enough. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. This will sound dramatic, but I was heartbroken at the disservice to the sea urchin. All that said, it won't prevent me from returning. Good goog good. The best place if we talk about all the \"tasting menu famous chefs\" restaurants in nyc. Finally an interesting menu with a nice combination of seasonable food. The menu changes and have a second tasting menu option (beside the classic one) according to the season. The egg caviar and the lobster were amazing. You are not going to find anything too buttery or with too much sauce in it that hide the flavor of the food. Nice tasting dessert too. The dining room is elegant, bright, but very simple, interesting the bar at the entrance. I love love love this place. The dining experience I had with Jean Georges was incredible. It's definitely one of the best French restaurants in town. The service is amazing, waitress was knowledgable in recommending their signature dish based on your preferences. We had the pre-fixe tasting menu for dinner and I love everything, everything! Also the marshmallow served as complimentary desserts was also fantastic; they are freshly served from a huge marshmallow jar, soft and mellow! I'm definitely coming back again for another tasting experience. Lunch special: $48 for 2 plates. Parsnip soup and hake were my fav. Took my mom and sister there, they both really liked the food and ambiance. Do not order flat water because they charge $20 for a bottle of Fiji water. Other than that, everything was amazing! Sometimes, when I have to dress up to go to a meal, I get so uncomfortable and sweaty that by the end of the meal my head hurts and I'm super tired and I want to strangle myself with my own tie. It was a reprieve to find the atmosphere of Jean-Georges refined and elegant but not pretentious. The girl at the table next to us was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt (granted, it was from Harvard). The lunch for $32 was an unbelievable deal considering the large portion sizes. I ordered the foie gras which was huge....almost didn't have the stomach to finish it (but of course I did). The filet was perfectly cooked. I didn't enjoy the miso-mustard sauce, which was fine because the meat had plenty of flavor on its own. My sister got the sweetbreads, probably the best dish all day. There's an Asian flair to all the dishes which is super fun, especially for an Asian. Pea shoots FTW. After eye-ing all the tables around us, we wondered desperately if the lavender macarons, marshmallows, and chocolates being served at every table were complimentary. Deciding to play it safe, we ordered the \"Caramel\" inspired dessert, which was good. And then ate all the aforementioned stuff, which was indeed free. After our meal I really felt like I ate something both creative and delicious. It didn't hurt my wallet either, which is always a bonus. Expensive? Absolutely.  Worth the spurge once a year? Absolutely. We all know that that the Red Book is not the perfect guide, but it isn't completely useless. I see Michelin Guide as the best available \"worldwide standard\" from Western customer's point of view. Entrance at Jean-Georges proudly displays Michelin 3 Star plaque.  DECOR: Due to the large windows, the place looked bright and cheerful, not stuffy and old. While it did not have nice paintings like Le Bernardin nor the luxury feel of Daniel, the place looked clean and smart. It gives off a more of a new \"approachable luxury\" feel. It makes you feel that perhaps the dinner won't be as expensive as you though - a feeling which will quickly dissipate by the time bill arrives at your table.  MENU: Prix Fixe course allows you to choose the first course from 9 choices, second course from 8 choices, third course (main dish) from 9 choices, and dessert from 4 choices. When you include the \"free\" starter plate, it turns out to be a 5 course meal. While I am sure that Chef's Tasting course is wonderful, I enjoyed the flexibility of choosing by going with prix fixe.  FOOD: Jean-Georges flavoring and seasoning agreed with my taste buds. Not overly salty nor too over whelmed by the spices, yet not bland. Just enough sauce helps pull out the natural taste of the ingredients. Food definitely went well with white wine. I would be careful on going with a bottle of heavy Bordeaux or Napa red to go with the entire course as that might kill the delicate flavoring of their dishes.  WINE: On the day I went, they offered 5 bubblies, 8 whites, and 7 reds by the glass (6 oz) or by taste (3 oz). You know that a place like this does not allow an opened bottle sit for days, so they are willing to deal with the high operating cost. Their selection of bottled wines is obviously impressive, but most importantly, they offered a pretty good selection of below $100 bottles.    PRICE: Unfortunately, I can only afford to visit Jean-Georges once a year, but the experience was certainly worth the price.    Example of dinner for two: $ 98 Prix Fixe course $ 98 Prix Fixe course $100 Bottle of Burgundy white $  6 Taste size glass of red $  7 Taste size glass of red $  3 Coffee $100 Tax and tip ---------------------------------- $ 450 Total  CONCLUSION: A disclaimer that I do NOT live in NYC, so my knowledge of city's restaurants is limiting, but of the restaurants I've tried so far, I put Jean-Georges right next to Daniel as my favorites in the city. Very interesting experience. Made reservation for 7 PM Monday several weeks in advance. Called early on Monday to try to push the reservation to 730 and was told there was no record of the reservation either by name or phone number and that there was no table available until 930. Checked with the other JG restaurant (Upper East) to ensure that I had not called the wrong place; no resv there either. Asked our hotel concierge to call and see if he could get us a resv at the original JG (Central Park). He was told: no problem, wide open, 730 is fine. So what's with the lost resv and unwillingness to take us without concierge intervention? Concierge said they like to mess with people. When we got there, my wife asked for the ladies' room so she could remove her boots and put on proper shoes - hostess told her to sit in the entranceway (between inner and outer doors) and do it there. Again, attitude on the incoming side. Once inside, it was as though the waitstaff and the \"welcome\" staff worked for two different restaurants. Attitude was friendly but professional. Service was absolutely superb. Food was excellent (particularly the foie gras). When my wife's duck came too rare, our waitress removed BOTH our plates and the kitchen completely re-prepared BOTH our dishes without a murmer (mine was fine in the first place, but our waitress said it would suffer from waiting on a re-do of the other dish). Overall a 4.5 star experience, but not everything was perfect. So.... 4-4.5 stars all in all. Came here for lunch and went with the 2 course lunch + dessert + coffee.  Perfect service. Veeeeery slow, but otherwise impeccable service and friendly waiters.  Bread - Left much to be desired. You can't beat the bread at Le Bernardin, but here I could've done without. Nothing special here.  Amuse bouche - The miso soup with popcorn was BIZARRE. It was just gross. On the other hand, the cucumber (with something in it i can't remember) and the watermelon with cheese cream (?) were tasty.  Tuna ribbons - Perfect. The fish was fresh. The plate was beautiful. It tasted more like cold noodles than fish, how'd they do it?! Black bass - Yum. The broth, the crust, the tomatoes were delightful. Deliciously seasoned.  Chocolate dessert - Chocolate cake, meyer lemon ice (on top of vanilla ice cream). Tasty but nothing particularly creative or interesting. Honestly, molton lava cake is delicious but simple. Nothing too impressive. Didn't particularly care for the meyer lemon   ice.. it was way too strong and didn't blend well with the ice cream below it. Petit fours- Strawberry coconut macaroons. Three types of chocolates (peppermint, hazelnut, sour cherry). All delicious.  Passion fruit lime drink - blech! $12 for that? Seriously? I felt like I was drinking passion fruit syrup with some weird spices mixed in. It was my least favorite item. Amazing. Nothing else needs to be said. Jean Georges may well be the culinary highlight of my life.  While I try not to repeat restaurants in other cities, Jean Georges is something I will never get sick of, I'm already planning our next NYC trip and it is on the list of \"musts.\"  From the superb service to the beautiful decor, our meal there was thoroughly enjoyed. If you're keen on carbs like I am, have the pretzel bread, it's soft and salty - delicious. My favorites were the Toasted Egg Yolk, Caviar and herbs, Grilled Foie Gras Dumplings, Foie Gras Brule, Steamed Maine Lobster, Spaghetti Squash and Yuzu Vinaigrette and JG's Chocolate Cake, Vanilla Bean ice cream. The housemade Vanilla Marshmallows served tableside from a huge, clear jar were at once fanciful and fulfilling.  Our waitress was so gracious and accomodating. Upon finding out we were from California, home of the foie gras ban, she actually went to ask Chef if we could sub one of our courses with another foie course. Happily, Chef told her he would be happy to do a tasting portion of the Grilled Foie Dumplings. We were also fortunate enough to be able to have both the Chocolate and Orchard Dessert Tastings.  The ladies at the front desk were also very nice and offered to take our picture for us in front of the signage.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm used to California sized tasting portions, but halfway through dinner, I was completely full. Never in my life have I left a restaurant so thoroughly satiated. JG, you blew this jaded San Franciscan's mind. 3 stars for the Michelin Guide is great, but 3 stars on yelp? not so hot.  Let me start off by saying that if I had come in here not knowing this was a michelin starred restaurant, this review might be bumped up to 4 stars... but for a restaurant that has a reputation of being one of the 5 restaurants in New York that has the three star rating.. I felt the food was just not good enough. The service was great. Waters refilled at a timely manner, and our server was personable without being too chatty. I really liked her demeanor as she was never snotty or stiff. The room is beautiful and felt fresh with large floor to ceiling windows that let in plenty of natural light into the dining room.  I ordered three items from their lunch menu while my boyfriend picked four and we each ordered our own two plate dessert tasting. For the savories, it begins at $38 for two items, but for an additional $19 charge/per plate, you can select more plates.  I had the egg caviar appetizer with two plates of different fish. My boyfriend got a crab dumpling appetizer with the fish, suckling pig and wagyu beef. I think out of our entire combined 7 plate selection, There really was not a single dish that really stood out to me. If I had to pick the most unique experience, it was the signature jg caviar egg. It was my first time trying caviar and I would have to say it wasn't too bad of an experience. Mixed together with the cream and the soft scrambled egg, it did taste strangely like a mcdonalds cheeseburger like one yelper before me had mentioned in his review lol. It sounds crazy but I get what he's saying. If I had to pick a favorite dish, It would probably be the suckling pig entree my boyfriend picked. I enjoyed the crispy skin on top and the soft tender pork meat that had been pulled apart and reshaped into a rectangular piece.  I did however enjoy dessert, but I generally always do. I ordered the chocolate tasting while my boyfriend got the fruit tasting. I think the fruit tasting plate was miles better than the chocolate one. Both his poached pear and his caramel apple ice were DELICIOUS. My molten lava cake and white chocolate mousse with yuzu ice tasted pretty unoriginal.  My verdict: The flavor of the food.. not really sure what jean george was thinking. I'm not a fan of his play on asian flavors. A lot of what I ate(particularly the fish) was unfortunately a little bland in taste, and lacked the complexity of flavors that I crave.  Was this entire meal worth our $300+ check? Mmm, maybe for the experience to try a three star restaurant so that you know what to compare when you go dine at another three star restaurant. In other words, if you are into trying all the world's best restaurants to see what they are like or if you have the cash to burn, I'd say go for it. If you are looking to try the best 3 star restaurant with the little money that you have saved up for it, I would definitely pick something else. This was a very nice experience, and not over the top. My lamb entre was exceptional, literally one of the best I have ever tasted. Our staff was knowledgeable and friendly. I will definitely return. Is this what Michelin calls a 3 star restaurant? If I had known in advance the experience we've had, I would have spent my evening elsewhere. This was absolutely not French cuisine. Food was bad (a ravioli filled with pumpkin puree? I thought texture was one of the basics in cuisine), sorry but I really hated every single bite of it and service was also bad (fake smiles, waiters gossiping about the customers behind the curtains, pouring still water in my glass of sparking water). I am really disappointed by the experience I had at Jean George and would never recommend it to people who really know how to appreciate French cuisine. Excellent VALUE for the food you are getting. My wife and I are from San Francisco, and you would spend the same amount of money for a 1 Michelin star restaurant (e.g., Gary Danko's), while Jean-Georges is a 3 star. The food really was superb. I generally consider my palate excellent, able to distinguish ingredients and compositions better than the average person - thus, I tend to be very picky when it comes to high-priced foods. However, I was really wowed by how well this restaurant uses combinations of ingredients and spices that I seldomly see elsewhere. The first two courses I had were wonderful: My first course were sauteed scallops topped with roasted cauliflower, topped off with a caper-raisin emulsion Who would have thought that capers and raisins would somehow come together like that (at least without anchioves right)? The goat cheese royale (with beet puree and toasted pistachios) was wonderful. I was surprised by how the beets and pistachios also somehow came all together.  Of course, my meal was really topped off by the wagyu beef. Perfectly cooked to a medium, with a slightly crispy outside. Just awesome. My wife also had a wonderful 3 course dinner here - I am not going to bore you with it (but really, her fois gras was amazing). But for the gentlemen, here is the \"catch\": the standard $98 prix fixe menu is supposed to be \"only\" 3 courses, but it is really 4, as dessert is included. And they give you ample portions for all of these courses; thus, the standard 3 course really is more than sufficient as we were absolutely stuffed. With some wine and coffee and some additions to your fixe...well...it only came to a little over $300 for my wife and I.  All of that plus wonderful service for a 3 Michelin star restaurant. I realy don't think it will get better for anyone looking for a superb meal in NYC than that. Absolutely great value for amazing food here. No complaints; all compliments. 3 Stars yes I get it, the Trump tower yes I get it, Jean-Georges yes I get it. Its a big deal. Was it the best 3 star I ever had. Not not really. Was still incredible of course. Do I really need to describe the food here to you? That is sort of like me trying to play a Stradivarius. It will only hurt your ears and do injustice to the food. Lets just say the place did not disappoint and met every expectation I had. Not only the most expensive and ostentatious restaurant I've ever dined in, but one existing an entirely separate culinary cosmos for its reputation, articulation of menu and idiosyncratic offerings. Friend took me, and I think if you're going to bother, it's worth trying out the tasting menu. I think over-rated would not even begin to address even the most modest expectations and exceptional [or any synonym or related word] not the adjective it deserves to be considered with. And yet, shouldn't something remotely in the universe that this exists in, offer an incomparable or at least outrageous dining experience? In my estimation, it should but it doesn't Expressly Caligulaean and decadence made edible with unsatisfying results. I must say this is the best restaurant I have ever been to. I have been to some of the top french restaurants in NYC such as Daniel & Bouley and I must say Jean Georges tops my list.  Dim and Romantic setting, service is outstanding and the dinner was unforgettable. I started off the sea scallops w/ caramelized cauliflower followed by butternut squash soup and finished off my dinner with minted rack of lamb. I also had the caramel dessert tasting. It consisted of four different styles of desserts all using caramel in a different type of way.  I cannot express how wonderful each course was. It was an anniversary dinner so this a is a great place for a romantic outing with a girlfriend/wife. I can't wait to go back ! Wow, where to begin?? I know there are already a ton of reviews for Jean-Georges, but I loved my lunch here so much that I just need to add my two cents. My sister and I came here on a beautiful Saturday afternoon for their prix fixe lunch. I have to say that everything from the service, to the setting, to of course the food, was practically perfect. I am somewhat chincy with 5-star reviews--I have to REALLY like a place--and this one fits my bill.  A restaurant like this easily could cut some corners at lunch, or not offer a fantastically priced menu, or the servers could be grumpy because their tips will be smaller at lunch. But no, they are a class act all the way. Even though I have yet to eat here for dinner, I can feel that they deserve all 3 of their Michelin stars. To start I had a half glass of sparkling, I believe a cremant d'Alsace? I don't quite remember. But it was very tasty, and I loved that half glasses were an option. The amuse alone was so substantial that it was practically a full appetizer--3 little items. I've never had such an intricate amuse. One of the pieces was the best cured salmon I've ever had in my life. Incredible.  I had peekytoe crab dumplings for my first course. They were light and delicate, with little celery leaves on top. For the second course I chose the nut-crusted sea bass (I believe) with a sweet-sour broth and small tomatoes, pearl onions, and potatoes on the side. It was absolutely wonderful, but a bit on the rich side due to the butter in the sauce. The server did warn me about that so I knew ahead of time...next time I would maybe pick something lighter, depending on my mood. The fish was really perfectly done, with not a trace of grease in the crust. What a little party of flavors and textures! We were too full for dessert, as the portions were very generous. I fully expected to come out of there not full, but I was stuffed! The mignardises, like the amuse, were the most generous I have ever encountered, and absolutely wonderful. There was a sesame-yuzu macaron, little chocolates (the most wonderful was the passion fruit!) and freshly cut vanilla bean marshmallows. Those were absolute heaven. The table we had was semi-private and set back into the wall, with a fantastic view out the window. I thought it was one of the most romantic tables in the house, perfect for a lovely date. My sister and I left on a cloud of happiness, and will likely be talking about this lunch for a long time to come. I can't wait to go back to NYC for lunch at Jean-Georges again! Depending on what you order off the lunch menu, your experience could range from a 3 to a 5. The Good - Basically, everything my marital unit ordered. The SB sea urchin was fantastic. We first tasted citris, then the ocean, then some heat. The foie gras with granola was very creative, and the strawberries (a blend of wild and non-wild) were very sweet and complimented the other ingredients well. The crunchy granola really offset the softness of the foie gras The suckling pig was the best I've ever had. The skin was very crispy and the confit preparation made the meat very soft and tender. Our server was very attentive and informative. The Bad - Basically, everything I ordered (the dishes weren't bad, but they were pretty average). The sea scallops with caper-raisin emulsion was ok. The scallops were not very sweet and the capers were pretty overwhelming. The warm gulf shrimp was cooked well but the peach cocktail did not give it enough flavor. The whole dish wa a bit bland. The artic char was cooked well but it also didn't stand out. We shared the stonefruit dessert, and the peach tart pretty good. I would also recommend theyir housemade sodas, including the cherry-yuzu. The Ugly - We were seated in an intimate booth facing the dining room. The decor was modern, classic and a little sparse. Most of the tables seemed to have some bench/sofa seating. The flowers on the table were a nice touch. This was first time that I went to a 3 Michelin Star restaurant and boy was it worth something else. My fiance and I each got a tasting menu, I got the Winter Tasting and he went with the Jean George Tasting, both were amazing in their own ways, but I will highlight the combination of dishes that made the meal absolutely fantastic. For a starter, that was not on the menu, the fluke sashimi with tangerine snow tasted so wonderful, the sour taste from the snow along with the cold temperature to keep the sashimi chilled was perfect. Both of our first appetizers were caviar themed and heightened our expectations for the meal even more. His caviar was topped on cream with scrambled eggs that tasted of airy richness and mine was topped on a \"toasted\" egg yolk sandwich of sorts.  The Foie Gras was probably the best dish of the night. It tasted of perfection as it slowly melted in my mouth. The lobster tartini was the best lobster dish that I had tasted as the juicy flavors of lobster complimented by the crostini and tomato broth gave way to the lightly cooked pea tips and pods. The dessert tastings gave so many flavors and varieties and if there's something to be desired here, its that they try hard to please everyone and dont really cater to one person's taste. Nonetheless, the extra palette cleanser sorbet and the chocolates afterwards were nice extras that were added to the mix. Even though I focused only on the food, because it was truly exceptional, the service and decor are top notch. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a culinary experience. expensive restaurant with very classy and formal atmosphere. last time i went was a restaurant week. i did not realize that the restaurant was very contemporary and chic. my outfit wasnt that fit for the restaurant.. ;( anyways, the food is very simple and clean but had alot of flavors. it was pretty noisy, but maybe because there were so many customers! I wasn't impress with the menu from the restaurant week,  but will want to come back for the whole 3 course meal. Ambiance and service was great. Food was very fresh but lacks flavor in my opinion. My bf and I would rate it as a one star michelin, not 3 due to simple fact that food lacks flavor. Not to say food wasn't good. It just lacks uniqueness and flavor. We ordered the winter special and the black truffle tasting menu. The foie gras (on the truffle menu) is one of the best foie gras I've had. The amuse bouche is good, but i've always loved it no matter which restaurant. The sashimi was pretty decent. Step in here and get ready to be wow-ed. Sure, a six-course tasting menu for lunch is a little over the top, but hey, you're at Jean Georges... that's already over the top as is. The food was creative, sophisticated and intricate (what other good adjectives can I throw in?), so take a good look at the menu and enjoy whatever you put in your mouth (twss).  The only change that I'd make is to come back for dinner instead of lunch. Definitely too much food for that early on in the day. But they also have a great lunch menu where you pick two dishes for $38 and $19 for each additional dish. That sounds like a steal for a three-starred Michelin restaurant.  I left full and happy. And I was still full when for dinner that night. Will be returning in no time. Oh la la!!! C'est si bon!!!! Today's lunch at Jean-Georges to celebrate my new job position in style was a big hit!!! It totally made my day! As a Michelin 3 star restaurant, my dining experience lived up to its expectations as far as food and service were concerned, but I wasn't impressed by the decor and the ambiance. Although I like the bright and airy setting, it's too boring and simple for my taste. I want to see more bling, but that's just me. For a budget-conscious foodie like myself, $29 two-plate tasting menu lunch is the smartest way to sample the innovative gourmet meal without breaking the bank. My friend and I ordered different dishes so that we can try each other's food and compare!  1)Amuse-bouche trio(ravioli in duck consomme soup/ raw salmon with blood orange/fried cheese and potato fritter ) - Ils sont delicieux! My fave was the salmon and blood orange combo, a nice sweet and salty complex flavor! 2)Foie Gras Brulee (served w/spicy pineapple puree) - Oui ouiiiiii!!!!! I love it!!!! Sensational!! It tastes expensive and dangerous! 3)Gulf shrimp, kabocha pumpkin, water chestnuts, saffron, and chipotle - super succulent shrimps cooked in a very interesting and creative sauce that tastes sweet, sour, and salty. Me like! 4) Red Snapper Crusted with nuts and seeds, sweet and sour jus - WoW wOw WoW!! Watch out Le Bernardin!! Again, the sauce really continues to impress me, can I drink it all? Sooo good!! I hardly eat red snapper but this I would love to eat everyday if I can!! 5)Grilled Beef Tenderloin And Crunchy Potatoes tomato compote with chillies and garlic - SUPEEEEERBE!!!!! Does Jean-Georges know this is exactly how I like my meat prepared?? It reminded me of my favorite grilled steak I had in Japan, with a subtle hint of soy-sauce or whatever it is. 6) Jean-Georges chocolate cake, vanilla bean ice cream, and a bowl of peppermint sauce with more ice cream and cocoa noodles($8) . - Mmmmmm!!! Instant winner!  7) Apple theme dessert ($8) - creatively fancy and interesting, but not my fave. It's too light and citrusie . 8) Complimentary sweets (marshmallows, 4 different flavor chocolates, & coffee macarons) - very delicious except I didn't care too much for the marshmallows. Go before Jean-Georges comes to his senses and stop giving amazing lunch deal!!! Allez-y!!!! I really hope he doesn't discontinue this affordable prix-fixe!!! Si'l vous plaaaaaaait!!!! Lunch at Jean Georges was one of my first meals on a recent NYC trip and it certainly did not disappoint. The two course lunch is an excellent way to try the food and environment before committing to the full deal at dinner. It's a relatively good value at $39 dollars, but note that there are items on the menu with supplemental fees.  The meal starts off with an amuse bouche trio of: raw fluke, fig and cheese skewer and shot of potato puree soup with a hint of truffle. My first course was the Foie Gras Brulee, which was a cold preparation. I normally only like seared foie, but this preparation was quite interesting. For my entree I had the cod, which was cooked just right, flaky and perfectly seasoned. I was pretty full at this point and passed on dessert. They did bring out petite fours at the end of the meal which consisted of house made marshmallow, macaroons and chocolates.   The one aspect of the meal that really stood out was how immaculately orchestrated the entire lunch service was. The presentation of each course and setup for the next course was perfectly choreographed. Every single member of the waitstaff performed their functions in a overt manner that was never intrusive even though there was staff stationed all over the room to make sure everything flowed smoothly. One of our dining companions did not particularly like her appetizer course. The waiter saw that she barely made a dent in her dish and graciously offered to swap it out even though she said it was not necessary. They really make a point of making sure their customers are happy and enjoying themselves! Dining at Jean Georges was a great start to my trip and I'll definitely be back again. I may opt for dinner the next time to experience the full range of the chef's creations. --------LUNCH ONLY------- I really wanted to like this place. It was good but it's hard to give it a good rating after eating Daniel & Per Se the two nights before. How are all 3 of them in the same ranking, I don't know. However, I did only come here for lunch and maybe I ordered the wrong items on the menu. Foie gras brulee- This was warm, rich, and a nice change from the standard foie gras. Sea trout sashimi with trout eggs, lemon, dill, horse radish - The horse radish completely overtook the taste by way too much. It left a really sour taste in your mouth. It looked promising but damn, it was way too sour for my liking. Red snapper crusted with nuts and sweeds - I've never had red snapper before so it was interesting to try. Full of flavor but probably not my favorite fish Steamed cod - This was cooked very well and flaked perfectly. Homemade Marshmellows - This was pretty cool. The waiter walks over with a big jar of white fluff and they turn out to be huge marshmellows. Pretty savory and a nice change from the cheap supermarket brand that I'm used to. Lavender Macaroons - Standard macaroons but I discovered that I like lavender one Overall, the meal was okay but I wasn't impressed (but it's hard to match Daniel & Per Se). The ambiance was really nice though. I'd probably skip this if another chance came to eat here. One of my biggest highlights of my most recent New York trip was dining here. It was one of the most remarkable meals I've ever had! Pricey, but the experience is worth every cent you pay. The lunch from the prix fixe menu had such great variety, leaving me rather speechless and indecisive! If only I could try everything... What I will never forget was the tasting plate - the goat cheese cracker was bursting with flavor, the little pea soup (?) shot unbelievable, and the sashimi with amazing texture. My appetizer dish was the steamed skate with a variety of greens.... again with the amazing texture of the fish. Tender and easily shredded, yet it was a bit chewy. I don't think I ever enjoyed veggies as much as this. My entree was the Veal Scallopine with flying pig ham, mushrooms, and lavender. Ok first of all, I wanted to try the flying pig ham, who could resist that kind of name?! It was extremely savory and delicious, but the lavender kept it refreshing and interesting, but not overpowering. Definitely an experience worth splurging your money on, trust me! I went there for lunch both times. Honestly, the best $39 pre-fixe menu I've ever come across anywhere in the world. I would definitely pay the extra $8 for the foie gras appetizer. It's AMAZING!!! I would eat it every day. Easiest way to do it is just ask for bar seating, and ask to order from JG. I just did it last week and I was in and out in 45 mins. I was excited to try this Michelin 3 star restaurant while I visited NYC during Christmas, but I was a little disappointed. Overall, the food was good, but a couple dishes were just mediocre (scallop and can't remember what the other one is, since it wasn't very memorable). Service was professional but robotic and not personable in my opinion. I may have too much expectation. Thought it would be a more unique experience given it's reputation. Visited last summer. My first Michelin 3 stars experience was good. Love the uni. Just curious, will the waitress ever smile? Very classy yet non-precocious small restaurant next door to Nougatine. At first, we were going to opt for the signature or seasonal tasting menus at the respective $148 or $168, but decided that the regular $98 three-course (four, if you count dessert) prixe fixe dinner offers a good variety of choices, many of which are included in the tasting menus anyway. They're known for seafood, so we made it a fishy night. Breads, Petit Fours 1st Sea Scallops (3 pieces, with caramelized cauliflowers on top; nice combo) Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons (the tuna was pretty fresh and paired well with the avocado and sweet and sour ginger marinade) [you can get the sensationalized signature egg caviar if you pay a $25 premium]  2nd Slowly Cooked Arctic Char (my friend's favorite dish of the night, due to the delicious crust atop the fish) Turbot (it's pronounce it tur-BO, not TUR-bit; it was not as spectacular/memorable as the arctic char... perhaps the buttery sauce is what made it one of JG's signature dishes) 3rd Black Sea Bass (quite ordinary) Duck Breast (meat was soft, and I really liked the amaretto jus for dipping)  Dessert [a flight of 4 themed tastings] Chocolate (some cake, ice cream, etc, featuring salted caramel) Autumn Fruits (some sorbet, creme brulee, tart, cheesecake) Marshmallows (cut at your table before your eyes), chocolates, more chocolates boxed to take home. We got some cocktails, which they tended to pour heavy-handedly. Service never faltered; the everyone was well dressed (simplistic, not over-the-top), and I did not have to raise my voice to keep a conversation. This place deserves its recognition. This fancy Michelin restaurant just didn't knock my socks off. First off, we had to wait quite awhile in the lobby, though we had reservations. As for the food-I got the risotto which was pretty good, but risotto normally is. I also got the beef tenderloin-it was soft and a bit juicy, but nothing that made my mouth burst into a happy frenzy. The dessert was the best part-ordering a plate of chocolate sweets. The purple macaroons were tiny yet hard, and the big marshmallow was unique yet flavorless (as most marshmallows, right?). The service was fine, and I enjoyed eating a couple rounds of bread (esp the sesame!). Other than that, I really didn't see what was so *fantastic about the food. One word describes my whole experience at this place, A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! I have been to many Michelin-rated restaurants, but very few could blow me away that I started to question myself if I have been too spoiled with all the fine dining experiences, or that all these Michelin restaurants are really not a big of a deal. Jean-Georges just proved me wrong. I was blown away by almost everything. The service is impeccable, the dining room is beautiful and the food is just outstanding!  For lunch, you have 2 options, two plates for $38 or tasting menu (which consists of 6 courses) for $148. I think the price is very reasonable, you just won't get to pay this price at other 3 star Michelin restaurants! I chose foie gras brule and crispy confit of suckling pig for my two plates. Words can't describe the food. It is just like an art, and you can't describe an art. I am still dreaming about the whole thing now. Will go back to try the tasting menu!\n"
